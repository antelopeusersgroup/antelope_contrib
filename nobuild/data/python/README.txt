The Antelope python interface code has been placed into the 'nobuild'
directory because it has been adopted into the BRTT core Antelope
distribution for support and evolution under the auspices of BRTT.
The historical source-code has been left here in the Antelope-contrib
repository as a resource for people who are running older versions
of Antelope, as a record of open-source work, and/or for those who
may benefit from seeing the programming details. This code should
not be compiled into a modern version of Antelope lest potentially
serious conflicts occur between the old version and the new.

IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPILE THIS OLD, OPEN-SOURCE VERSION 
OF THE ANTELOPE PYTHON INTERFACE IF YOU ARE RUNNING ANTELOPE VERSION 5.2-64 OR LATER.
FAILURE TO HEED THIS WILL NECESSITATE RE-INSTALLATION OF ANTELOPE.
