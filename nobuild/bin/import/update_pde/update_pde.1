.SH NAME
update_pde \- retreive files of reviewed monthly hypocenter data from NEIC and incorporate them into a local css3.0 format catalog. 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBupdate_pde\fR [-v ] -y year -p parameter_file
 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script retreives EHDF format files from the NEIC ftp site (currently 
hazards.cr.usgs.gov) via the NET::FTP perl module.  Files are retrieved and 
stored in a local directory and are converted to css3.0 format via the 
pde2origin(1) program distributed with the ANTELOPE software package.  

The remote site is checked for new or modified files (under the "pde" 
directory).  If such a file is found, it is retrieved and then converted 
to css3.0 format.  The modification times are checked against files stored 
under a "YYYY_HDF_monthly" directory.  If a modified file is found, 
update_pde checks the local pde catalog and adds in any new or modified
origins from the retrieved file.

Files retreived are of the form ehdfYYYYMM.dat (MM is the two-digit month of 
the year YYYY).  Format specifics can be found in the file ehdf.doc.  Yearly
files ehdfYYYY.dat are rejected.

See:
ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/pde/read_me for additional info.

A typical file will look like this:

.nf

etc.

The users listed in mail_to specified in the pf file should receive an email message when the program fails or runs
to completion.


.SH OPTIONS


.IP -v 
verbosely report what the program is doing and any errors that may occur.

.IP "-y year"
4-digit year to retrieve.  PDE yearly files are availible from this
site from 1990 to ~10-12 months prior to today.

.SH PARAMETER FILE

This script requires a parameter file, normally called update_pde.pf. 
The following is an example parameter file.

.nf

# Paramter file for update_pde

pde_dir         /catalogs/pde/        # Directory where you are going to store all pde monthly catalog info.

remote_host     hazards.cr.usgs.gov      # The ftp site run by the USGS, should not have to change

author          PDE_monthly           # Name to fill in to author field for monthly catalog

account         myname@ucsd.edu       # email address for anonymous ftp

mail_to  &Tbl{                        # Users to be notified
myname@ucsd.edu, someonelse@bigmoney.com
}


.fi 

.LP
The parameter file consists of the following information.

.IP "pde_dir"

This is the directory (full path) where you want to store the pde catalog and individual files.  The catalog will
be written here and will be called pde_YYYY.  You need to have read/write permissions here.  The 
script will try to create this directory if it does not exist.  Additional directories will be created
under this directory including: temp and YYYY_HDF_monthly/. 

.IP "remote_host"

The ftp site at USGS that allows ftp pickup of the PDE bulletin.  This has changed over the years, but
as of January 2008 it is: hazards.cr.usgs.gov.

.IP "author"

The fill value for the author field in the origin table.

.IP "account"

This is required by the perl ftp module for anonymous access to the remote host.

.IP "mail_to"

List of users who will receive email when this program is run.


.SH FILES

pde2origin(1) is used to convert the files in EHDF (or PDE) format to css3.0 format.  Files
are saved to "qed_dir/qed_store/".

ehdf.doc describes the data format.

ehdfYYYYMM.dat contains hypocenter data for on month (MM) of the year (YYYY). 

pde_YYYY.origin is created in the "pde_dir" directory.

pde_monthly.log is created in the "pde_dir" directory.

pde_mail.log is created in the "pde_dir" directory.


.SH EXAMPLE
.br
1) Update the pde catalog for 1998 using parameter file pf/update_pde_local.pf
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 4

%\fB update_pde -v 1998 -p pf/update_pde_local\fP

.fi
.ft R
.in 

.br
2) You want to set up a cron job to run the 1st day of every month to update the monthly pde catalog.

As the real-time user, add the following to the crontab &Arr for a running rtexec.pf:

.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 4

 get_pde  UTC 0 21 1 * * update_pde -v update_pde -y 2003

.fi
.ft R
.in 

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
bulletin2orb(1)
pde2origin(1)
antelopeenv(5)
update_weekly_qed(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
You may want to use the \fBbulletin2orb\fP program instead as it utilizes the netmag table.
.LP
Env variables PFPATH and ANTELOPE must be set.
.LP
There is a hard-wired path to gzip in the code (/usr/bin/gzip).
.LP
Also hard-wired is the directory (pde/) where the PDE files are
stored on the USGS ftp site.
.LP
This code has not been extensively tested.  It may fail in unexpected ways.
