update_pde has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because
it has been deprecated. The program may still work and may be 
of value, however the author offers absolutely no promises or 
support for it. update_pde was initially written prior to 2000 
and has not been maintained or supported for a long time.  The 
USGS no longer updates the ftp site supplying PDE files for 
event data past 2014.
