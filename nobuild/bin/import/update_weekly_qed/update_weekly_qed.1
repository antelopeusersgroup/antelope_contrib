.SH NAME
update_weekly_qed \- retreive files of reviewed weekly hypocenter data from NEIC and incorporate them into a local css3.0 format catalog. 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBupdate_weekly_qed\fR [-v ] parameter_file
 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script retreives EHDF format files from the NEIC ftp site (currently ghtftp.cr.usgs.gov) via the NET::FTP perl module.  Files are retrieved and stored in a local directory and are converted to css3.0 format via the \fBqed2origin\fR program distributed with the ANTELOPE software package.  

The remote site is checked for new or modified files (under the "pub/weekly" directory).  If such 
a file is found, it is retrieved and then converted to css3.0 format.  The modification times are 
checked against files stored under a "qed_store" directory.  If a modified file is found, 
\fBupdate_weekly_qed\fR checks the current qed_weekly catalog and will add any new or modified
origins that exist for the time period of the retrieved file.  

Files retreived are of the form ehdfYYYYWWw.dat (WW is the two-digit week of the year YYYY) and contain one week of data.  Format specifics can be found in the file ehdf.doc which should also be retrieved.  The file ehdfqed.dat contains approximately 3 weeks of hypocenter data from the Quick Epicenter Determinations (QED) publication and is updated daily. The weekly bundled data is about 3 months behind current date.

A typical file will look like this:

.nf

The following is an example parameter file.

.nf

# Paramter file for update_weekly_qed

qed_dir         /scr/month/eakins/qed/          # Directory where you are going to store all qed weekly catalog info.

author          QED_weekly                      # Name to fill in to author field of weekly catalog

account         eakins@epicenter.ucsd.edu       # email address for anonymous ftp

mail_to  &Tbl{                                  # Users to be notified
eakins@epicenter.ucsd.edu
}


.fi 

.LP
The parameter file consists of the following information.

.IP "qed_dir"

This is the directory (full path) where you want to store the weekly qed catalog.  The catalog will
be written here and will be called qed_weekly.  You need to have read/write permissions here.  The 
script will try to create this directory if it does not exist.  Additional directories will be created
under this directory including: temp and qed_store. 

.IP "author"

The fill value for the author field in the origin table.

.IP "account"

This is required by the perl ftp module for anonymous access to the remote host.

.IP "mail_to"

List of users who will receive email when this program is run.


.SH FILES

qed2origin(1) is used to convert the files in EHDF (or PDE) format to css3.0 format.  Files
are saved to "qed_dir/qed_store/".

ehdf.doc describes the data format.

ehdfqed.dat contains the last ~3-7 weeks of data.

ehdfYYYYWWw.dat contains hypocenter data for the two-digit week (WW) of the year (YYYY). 

qed_weekly.origin is created in the "qed_dir" directory.

weekly.log is created in the "qed_dir" directory.

mail.log is created in the "qed_dir" directory.


.SH EXAMPLE
.RS .2i
.RE

1) Update the qed_weekly catalog using parameter file pf/update_weekly_qed.pf

update_weekly_qed pf/update_weekly_qed


2) You want to set up a cron job to run every night at 21:00 UTC to update the weekly qed catalog.

As the real-time user, add the following to the crontab &Arr for a running rtexec.pf:

 update_weekly_qed	UTC 0 21 * * * update_weekly_qed -v update_weekly_qed
