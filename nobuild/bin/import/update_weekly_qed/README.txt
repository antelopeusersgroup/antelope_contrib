update_weekly_qed has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory 
because it has been deprecated. The program may still work and 
may be of value, however the author offers absolutely no 
promises or support for it. update_weekly_aed was initially written 
prior to 2000 and has not been maintained or supported for a 
long time.  The USGS no longer updates any ftp site supplying 
weekly qed files.
