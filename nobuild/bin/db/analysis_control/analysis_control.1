.TH ANALYSIS_CONTROL 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
analysis_control \- database checkout/checkin utility for daily processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBanalysis_control \fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBanalysis_control\fP utility is a graphical tool for managing processing
of detected seismic events by several analysts. The utility allows an
analyst to check out a database that no one else is working on, and check
it back into the system when done. Several cleaning tasks are performed
by aeic_dbclean, which is launched by this tool. Analyzed data are also
submitted to NEIC via db2neic(1).

The \fBanalysis_control\fP script will not allow a database to be checked in if
there are no rows in it, nor if any of the preferred origins still have
the automatic system (binder) listed as author.
