pforbstat has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because
it has been adopted into the BRTT core Antelope distribution for
support and evolution under the auspices of BRTT. The historical
source-code has been left here in the Antelope-contrib repository
as a resource for people who are running older versions of Antelope, 
as a record of open-source work, and/or for those who may benefit 
from seeing the programming details. This code should not be compiled
into a modern version of Antelope lest potentially serious conflicts 
occur between the old version and the new.
