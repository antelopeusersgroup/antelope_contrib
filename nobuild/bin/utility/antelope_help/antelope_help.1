.SH NAME
antelope_help \- manual page for antelope_help 1.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: antelope_help [\-h] [\-V] [\-p PORT] [\-b BIND] [\-n]
.PP
Simple HTTP server on Python that will serve all requests
for help documentation in the Antelope distribution.
.PP
Depends on the environment variable $ANTELOPE to be set
before running the script. This variable can be set by
sourcing the setup.sh or setup.csh file in your antelope
distribution.
.PP
The service will configure a simple HTTP server on the
host and will be bound to the localhost (127.0.0.1) interface
only to avoid exposing the directory to external requests.
This can be configured to all interfaces by setting the
value to (0.0.0.0) using the \fB\-\-bind\fR or \fB\-b\fR flags.
.PP
WARNING:
BINDING TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN LOCALHOST WILL BE A SECURITY RISK.
NO ACCESS RESTRICTIONS OF ANY KIND TO THE FILESYSTEM.
.PP
The system will not verify if the port is already in use by a different
process. If needed the port can be set using the \fB\-\-port\fR or \fB\-p\fR flags.
.PP
The process will automatically attempt to open a browser window
with the system's default browser on the main antelope.html page
for the distribution configured in the $ANTELOPE system variable.
If you want to run as a service then you can use the \fB\-n\fR or
\fB\-\-nobrowser\fR flags to avoid opening the initial page.
.PP
There is no verbose flag. The script will print every request
to STDOUT. Run with \fB\-h\fR or \fB\-\-help\fR flag to get the list of
options and default values.
