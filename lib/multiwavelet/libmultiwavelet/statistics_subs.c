/* This function pair of functions are simple M-estimators used
in mwap.  The first function works on scalar vectors and the second
computes an m-estimate of center for complex vectors by applying
the scalar function to real and imaginary parts separately.  
This code is not nearly as general as it would be if I were trying
to write the ultimate M-estimator code.  It has three things
frozen in that are not always optimal:
1.  The scalar code assumes the inputs are normal deviates
2.  We always use the Huber formula.
3.  The initial estimate is always based on the median.  
Treating the real and imag parts this way is not always
the right approach.  We found it worked well in the multiwavelet
analysis because the emphasis is on phase measurement, not amplitudes.
Literature on power spectral estimates, for example, argues that
the penalty should key on only the amplitude and ignore the phase.  
Anyway, it's what we do here right or wrong.

arguments:

x-float vector of length x to compute m-estimator based mean from.  
	x is copied and not altered.
mode == IQ_SCALE_RELATIVE will compute minimum scale factor allowed
	as initial median value*minscale.
	If mode is anything else, the value will be used verbatim
	as the minimum scale factor
minscale = minimum scale factor.  M-estimators can downward spiral
	throwing out more and more data till nothing remains if
	this is not used (note mode above connection).

/* This function uses m-estimators to estimate a three vector from 
a cloud of points in n-space.  The approach is comparable to 
computing the center of mass of cloud of equal mass particles.
We use a component median for the initial estimate of center, then compute
the m-estimator based on a Rayleigh distribution keyed on the 
l2 norm amplitude of the vector residual.  This is comparable to the 
estimation of phase in robust estimates of transfer functions
described by Chave and Thomson as we use a penalty function based on
a Rayleigh distribution.  It is not clear to the author if this is
valid for other than 2 vectors, but it surely is not a bad approximation
for 3-vectors.  Higher order spaces should use this with care. 

Arguments:

v -  n by nv matrix containing ensemble of data n-vectors.  These are assumed
	stored as in the blas in a pseudofortran sense as a continuous
	vector of floats with columns sequential (i.e. first column
	of v is elements v[0], v[1], ... , v[n-1] and second column
	starts at v[n].
n - length of vectors (number of rows in v)
nv - number of vectors (number of columns in v)
mode - switch (see below)
minscale - minimum error scale allowed.  Use depends on setting of 
	the mode variable with which it is associated.  Scale factor
	is determined here from interquartiles.  mode is as defined
	in M_estimator_float above using symbols SCALE_IQ_RELATIVE
	and SCALE_IQ_ABSOLUTE.  The former uses a relative scale derived
	from the scale factor determined on the first pass.  That is, 
	the minimum scale alllowed is vmag0*minscale (e.g. 0.01 would
	limit the minimum scale to 1% of the magnitude of the total n
	vector initial estimate.  Absolute scaling
	uses the limit straight up.    
mean - vector of length n to hold result.  Blindly assumed to be already
	allocated of length n.
weight - vector of length to hold final weights used in robust
	estimation.

Function returns a 3 vector it estimates from v.  This is an array
alloced in this function that needs to be managed externally.
