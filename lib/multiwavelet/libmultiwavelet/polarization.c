/* This function takes complex numbers x, y, and z defined by an 
eigenvector for a multiwavelet (would work for Fourier transforms
too, however) and returns a pointer to a structure that defines
the major and minor axes of the particle motion vectors defined
by those three complex numbers.  The up vector (assumed to be
three element vector) defines the direction used to resolve
the sign ambiguity inherent in defining an ellipse.  That is,
both the major and minor component directions are required
to have a positive projection in the up direction.  If they 
aren't the sign is flipped before returning.  Normally up 
would point [0,0,1] or in the up radial direction for P waves.
For S, it becomes more ambiguous and should be sorted out 
by a more complicated method.

The polarization information (defined by the Particle_Motion_Ellipse 
structure) is allocated within this routine.
