/*! This defines a standardized interface to a plot for the SEISPP library.

   This class is an attempt to abstract the basic plot functions required
   to plot and work with seismic data.  It inherits an abstract base class
   called BasicSeismicPlot which is a pure virtual base.  It also inherits
   Metadata as a convenient way to change plot parameters.  An anomaly that
   makes this a nonideal interface is that in the current implementation
   this requires the refresh method to force the new parameters to take
   effect.  It would be better if any parameter changes caused an immediate
   redraw, but the current version based on Xt and the Seisw Motif widget
   just can't do that.

   Because the implementation of this class is focused on the Seisw Motif
   widget there is a very important limitation to note.  One must never
   attempt to copy this object. The reason is that the X implemenation
   used here is simply not readily capable of handling multiple copies of
   the same object in the same program.  There are several good reasons for
   this but user should just realize the key rule - just don't ever try
   to create copies of this plot handle.  A C++ compiler might just
   allow you to do so because a default copy constructor and operator=
   are often created even if you don't declare them.

          Xwindows call.  Rather than override the get and put methods I judged it
          preferable to use this model.  That is, if you want to change an plot
          parameters use the Metadata put methods to change what you want.  When you
