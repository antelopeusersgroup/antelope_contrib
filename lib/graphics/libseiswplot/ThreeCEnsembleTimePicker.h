/* \brief Arrival time picker for three component data.

This object is aimed as a simple interface for a picking window
for measuring arrival times.   It is intended to do only that so it is
not a full picking gizmo like dbpick.

A design goal of this gizmo is to provide a mechanism to pick three-component
data cleanly to allow the user to quickly appraise the validity of a set of
picks in the context of all three components.  dbpick and sac, for example, are both
horrible for this purpose.  There are multiple ways one might do this, but
this gizmo was designed with multichannel data in mind where an implicit
assumption is that adjacent seismograms in ensemble order have enough similarity
that alignment by a common signal feature like the first break or a zero
crossing makes sense.

The implementation uses a motif widget used in dbxcor but operating in a very
different mode.   The user is presented with 3 windows, one for each of the
three components.   MB2 is used to pick times.   Because of the internal
limits of the seisw widget this has to be done like picking in seismic unix
and is more or less blind.  i.e. all that happens when a pick is made is a
value is stored internally.   If multiple picks are made on the same
station (in any window) the last pick made overrrides a previous pick.
The idea behind this approach is that the user would normally start with
one data component and pick each seismogram presented.   On exit the
caller should arrange to call the align method which will shift all
component windows to have 0 as the time just picked.   Normal procedure
would be to rearm the picker, tweek the picks, and again call align.
Repeat until happy.   The object intentionally does NOT contain any gui
elements to control this because an application can either add that
element to the gui or do this through the command line interface.

A VERY IMPORTANT limitation to keep in mind is that we assume that because
picking is blind the user will always call the align method before pulling
any of the data with any of the getters.   get_member_times and 
get_sta_times may not yield the right answer if this is not done.  There
are curently no safety features to protect the innocent from this feature.

  are stored in the t0shift metatdata attribute and can be accumulated.   i.e
  the same trace can be picked multiple times and the t0shift value will
  accumulate those changes.   For passive source data with an absolute

  time estimate (e.g. in an css database arrival table).*/
