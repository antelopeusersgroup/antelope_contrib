/*! \brief A processing object that can be used to process data through Matlab.

Matlab has become the FORTRAN of seismology and this processing object provides
a simple way to integrate matlab m file scripts into a processing program using
the SEISPP library.  It implements the abstract base class ExternalProcessor.
The way this processing object would normally be used is to implement
the following four steps:
(1) create the object, (2) load a data object into matlab through one of the
overloaded load methods, (3) run a processing script with one of the overloaded
process methods, and (optionally) (4) retrieve the result with on of the 
retrieve methods.  

This object uses the creations is initialization mode of OOP.  That is,
the model is that when the object is created the handle to matlab is
created.  That handle is assumed to remain active until it is released
by the explicit or implict call to the destructor of the object.
This is VERY IMPORTANT to recognize for this object because a processing
script can very easily tell matlab to exit.  The caller should not do 
this or an error will be generated when the destructor is called when
the object is destroyed.

\par
For ensembles of data it is often useful to examine various attributes
attached to the data.  For example, in reflection processing it is 
common to make plots of CDP fold versus CDP number or some other position
variable.  This is a generic function for doing this process and loading
the result into matlab as a vector.  Note that any ensemble members 
marked dead are simply skipped.  This is a potential indexing problem 
if multiple elements of any ensemble are extracted and compared in 
matlab.  i.e. chaos can result if the input ensemble is edited or
sorted between any loading of data to matlab.

\param ens input ensemble.
\param metadata_name is the internal name of the attribute to be sent
	to matlab for processing.
\param matlab_name is the symbolic name to be assigned to this attribute
	vector in matlab.
\param am AttributeMap object of namespace used for attributes in this
	program.  The Metadata object used in SEISPP to define data
	attributes uses an AttributeMap to define it's internal namespace.
	It is needed here mainly to allow type to be determined without
	requiring another template parameter.
\param matp the MatlabProcessor object to which data are to be loaded.
