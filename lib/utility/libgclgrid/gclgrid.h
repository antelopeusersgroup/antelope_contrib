 \brief Remap one grid to coordinate system of another.
  
   Sometimes it is useful when dealing with multiple grids to 
   allow an algorithm to make an assumption that all grids in the
   set have a common coordinate system.  This can avoid the
   overhead of conversion of points to and from geographical
   coordinates.  Experience has shown this is a nontrivial
   calculation and needs to be minimized for algorithms that
   might require large numbers of such conversions.  
   This function uses the set of parameters required to 
   define this transformation as arguments.  It is 
   a close cousin to two related procedures that use a
   grid object.  Use this one when it is inconvenient to 
   have to actually load another grid as a pattern.  
  
   Note that remap_grid can be called on field objects derived
   from this one with no effect as the grid geometry is not
   altered.  Only the coordinate system changes.
   Note the grid is altered in place so the grid object passed will
   be modified after this function completes.  The exception is if
   the grids are already congruent in which case it silently does nothing.
  
   \param g grid to be remapped (note it is a pointer).
   \param olat latitude (radians) of new origin
   \param olon longitude (radians) of new origin

   \param azn azimuth of the y axis in the new coordinate system.

/*! \brief Decimate a GCLgrid3d.

We sometimes want to decimate a grid. This procedure does this for
a 3D grid with variable decimation for each generalized coordinate 
axis.  An added compliation is the fact that because GCLgrids hae
the x3 direction directed upward in earth coordinates and the free
surface is so special, we work the x3 coordinate backward compared
to the others.  i.e. we for the n3-1 point to be the n3-1 point in
the result, not the 0 points.
