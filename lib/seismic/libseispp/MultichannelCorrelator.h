This is one of two overloaded methods for implementing cross-correlation in the

This procedure correlates two time series over the complete range of lags possible
for the size of the two traces.  
In this procedure x is the correlator and y is the trace against which x is correlated.

This procedure checks for gaps in the correlation window of y.  If any gaps are present
in the window the procedure returns immediately with a default TimeSeries object 
containing no data.  The caller should test for this condition by examining the 
live variable of the output.  The trace will be marked live if the correlation was
successful, but live will be false if gaps were detected and correlation failed.

A more subtle problem with gaps arises if on of the inputs (x or y) has a gap at
the beginning or end of the time window to be processed.  In the seispp library
this type of situation is not always flagged as a gap because it can happen 
naturally when, for example, dealing with segmented data derived either from
a triggered instrument or extraction from continuous data.  This situation is 
handled by testing the feasibility of the correlation by examining the size
of x and y.  If x is shorter than y this function returns a null seismogram
with no data and marked dead.  Thus, just as with an internal gap the caller
must handle this situation and always test for a return marked dead.

*  \brief Generalized array cross correlation object.
* 
*  Cross correlation is a common signal processing algorithm.  The standard
* equation defines the correlation between two time series.  In earthquake 
* seismology people have tended to focus on pairwise combinations of correlations
* resolving variations through a least squares fitting procedure.  Correlation
* in the exploration geophysics work is also common in multiple contexts, but
* the focus there is always multichannel.  The most common application is 
* deconvolution by correlation with a vibrator sweep in land seismic data.  
* Correlation is also use for other reflection processing.  For example, most
* systems allow first breaks to be picked by a cross-correlation algorithm.
* All exploration algorithms I know of are not pair-wise but multichannel. 
* That is, a single correlator is defined for the whole ensemble that is to
* be correlated (e.g. a measured or theoretical vibrator sweep) and this 
* function is correlated with each member of the ensemble.  This is the 
* appoach used by this processing object.  If you need to do pair-wise 
* correlations, use the overloaded correlation procedures.
* \par
*  This object implements multiple methods of multichannel cross-correlation.  
*  It uses a model foreign to most of us old procedural guys in that the creation
*  of the object involves the actual calculations behind the concept.  That is,
*  it isn't arguments in, data out.  It is arguments create the object that is
*  the result of the calculations;  in this case multichannel cross correlation.
*  Although foreign it makes for a clean design for this concept as it cleanly
*  encapsulates the output of the calculations.  Details of the algorithm used
*  are best left to other forms of documentation.  Usage is better described by
*  reading documentation for the member functions of the object.

	* initial estimate of the array beam.
	*
	* The "Basic" method does a simple cross correlation of each trace with a
	* reference trace passed either through the initial_beam parameter or the
	* reference_member parameter.  Other methods involve an iterative procedure
	* using a beam recomputed iteratively until convergence.  The basic algorithm
	* is correlate with beam, align stack using current lags, sum, repeat until
	* time shifts do not change.
	*
	* The robust methods differ from the simpler methods in the use of a penalty
	* function in forming the stack.  Currently two robust stacks are supported:
	* (a) a median stack and (b) a SNR weighting method.  The later is of greatest
	* value for highly variable signal to noise conditions.  The most significant
	* example is source correlations where different magnitude events can enter in
	* the same stack.  Note the SNR scheme is slightly more complicated than a signal
	* to noise estimate.  It is more coherence-like using a ratio of L2 norm of the
	* original data to the L2 norm of the residuals (amplitude adjusted stack) to
	* define the SNR. The formula used to compute the weight is:
		\f[
			w_i = { { {\bf b} \cdot {\bf y}_i (\tau_{max} ) }
				\over
				{ || {\bf y}_i ||   || {\bf r}_i || } }

	* \f$ {\bf y_i (\tau_{max} ) } \f$ is the ith member of the ensemble shifted to
	* so sample 0 is at the peak correlation value,  \f$ {\bf r}_i  \f$ is

	*   initial beam estimate.
	* \param reference_member optional reference trace to use as starting estimate of
	*	stack for robust method.  Ignored for other simple or median stack.
	*	(default false)
	* \param normalize if true cross-correlation traces will be normalized. (default false)

	* \param correlate_only when true cross-correlation with the reference trace is performed
	*       but the data are not stacked and the beam attribute of the object is a copy
	*       of the input reference trace.  Trace header (Metadata) attributes normally set by this
	*       object, however, set in the input ensmble, d. 
	* \param freeze is somewhat the reverse of correlate_only.  When true a stack is computed
	*       but lag estimates are all set to zero.  In this situation the cross-correlation 
	*       functions are still computed and stored in the xcor attribute but the peak 
	*       correlation will not normally be aligned on zero.  The peakxcor and amplitude_static
	*       vectors will be properly filled out and are defined relative to the computed stack.
	*       In short, this pretty much behaves like the default behaviour except no time shifting
	*       done.  (Default is false)  Note since this is the opposite of correlate_only
