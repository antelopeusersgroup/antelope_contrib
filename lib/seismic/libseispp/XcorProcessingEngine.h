/* \brief Processing object for multichannel correlator.

This is a processing object that can be used to process a series of gathers
using the MultichannelCorrelator object.  It is an model of a processing engine
that reads in data and produces output like an engine that eat fuel and air 
and produces power and exhaust.  The normal use is this sequence for each
gather to be processed:  (1) read data, (2) run MultichannelCorrelator on
these data, and (3) save results.   The options in running this are huge,
however, and this beast has a lot of variation.  The behaviour is controlled
by two different means.  First, on creation most parameters are set through
an input Antelope parameter file.  Second, this beast has a parallel 
object called XcorAnalysisSetting that contains input to this beast that
are volatile.  To use an automotive analogy, the pf is like parts selected
to create this engine at the factor.  The XcorAnalysisSetting object is like
the engine controls (throttle, choke, etc.).

This beast behaves expects very different data and behaves very differently
for each of these modes.  ContinuousDB assumes event gathers indexed
by an Antelope database using wfdisc. This can be segmented data in spite
of the name, but the model is the same.  That is time windows are carved 
from the input on the fly.  Provided the data segments are larger than requested
time gates there will be no issues.  EventGathers is a generalization of 
this mode.  We still assume event processing, but dbprocess is used to 
define the database view that drives the processing.  In this mode it is
essential that the commands passed to dbprocess contain a dbgroup command
to define ensemble grouping by event.  GenericGathers is similar to EventGathers
in how it expects to see input data, but does not assume the data are 
event gathers.  In the current implementation this somewhat implicitly 
assumes the input data are common receiver gathers used for source array 
processing, but the only place this matter much is in the save method.
