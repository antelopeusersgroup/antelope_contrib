// start = atmin + data_window.start - tpad while
// end = atmax + data_window.end + tpad.  In this relation atmin and
// atmax are computed minimum and maximum arrival times of all stations
// defined by the input receiver geometry.  data_window defines
// the base time window needed around each arrival time and tpad is a

// The algorithm keys on a chan string to select data from the database.
// Only 3 values are allowed for chan: Z,N,E.  If anything
// else is passed through chan the functio will throw a SeisppError exception.
// Z,N, or E are assumed cardinal directions.  They generate subsets of the 
// input defined by SEED channel codes.  The result will contain ALL Z,N, or
// E channels found in the requested time windows.  For example, if a station
