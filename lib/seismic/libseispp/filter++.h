/*! \brief Data processing object to implement standard signal processing filters.
*
* This object can be used to filter time series data by what is commonly called
* a time invariant filter.  That means the filter operator does not change with time.
* Such filters can be implemented by convolution as FIR filters, IIR filters through
* fixed coefficient ARMA operators, or through FFT methods.  The key concept is that 
* the filter properties never change and the same operator is applied uniformly 
* across a set of time series data.  
* \par
* This operator uses one scheme for data processing I call the "apply" method 
* model.  The constructor builds an object containing the recipe for the filter,
* but an "apply" method uses the parameters stored in the object to alter data. 
* The apply function itself is overloaded to allow an application to multiple
* base data types. 
* \par
* The current implementation leans heavily on the Antelope trfilter routines.
* The apply methods simple call that procedure directly with wrappers to handle
* the different data types.
