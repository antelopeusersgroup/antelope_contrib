// Partial constructor for a TimeSeries object driven by a Metadata object.
// This is essentially uses the Metadata object as a way to make a parameterized
// constructor with a potentially large and variable number of parameters. 
// The following parameters must exist in the Metadata object or the constructor
// will throw an exception:  samprate, time, and nsamp.  If the load_data
// boolean is true the function will attempt to read data using an additional
// set of keywords that must be in the metadata:  TimeReferenceType, datatype,
// dir, dfile, and foff.  TimeReferenceType is a string that must be either "relative"
// or "absolute".  datatype, dir, dfile, and foff are exactly as in a wfdisc record.
// An important current limitation is that only host 4 byte float datatype (t4 or u4)
// are allowed by this constructor.  If datatype is anything else the constructor will
// throw an exception.  
//
//\exception MetadataError object is thrown if any of the metadata associated with the 
//           keywords noted above are not defined.  
//\exception SeisppError is thrown for read errors when load_data is true.  
//
//\param md - Metadata object to drive construction.

//                     attributes derived from the Metadata object (see above).
