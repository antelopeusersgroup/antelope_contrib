/*! \brief Function object for weak ordering of Hypocenters in space-time order.

Hypocenter objects encapsulate the concept of earthquake locations on the Earth.  
Because a hypocenter is a four-vector defining locations of an event in space time what
ordering means is a more elaborate concept than people commonly think.  This function 
object defines order using a space-time concept based using P waves as the equivalent
of the speed of light for the Earth.  Time order of events is established by computing
the origin time of each pair of events corrected for the P wave propagation time to 
a standard origin.  Default in this library is lat 0.0, lon 0.0, and sea level.
Network operators who use this code may want to customize the origin as some 
sensible origin in the center of their network.  Since I was writing this with a
global perspective I didn't crack the tough nut of figuring out how to parameterize
a set of constants like this in a function object.  I'm sure it is possible, I just
couldn't figure it out and had to move on for lack of time.  For now the origin
is hard wired as a set of constants.

There is a second hard wired constant in this that is more subtle as it is linked
to the use of this function object inside the EventCatalog object defined below.
That object's implementation uses an STL map of Hypocenters using this compare
function to compare members.  Equality is a nontrivial issue with Hypocenter members
because location errors render this question far from simple.  Two parameters are
hard wired into this code linked to this concept.  vp is the velocity used to convert 
time differences to space differences.  Two events are effectively treated equal if 
their space times positions (using vp) are less than rmax (units of km).  Parameters
here are reasonable for global solution, but network operators using this code
for regional networks may want to change these parameters.
