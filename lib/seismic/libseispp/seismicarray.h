 The algorithm used to define the time window is this:

 atmax are computed minimum and maximum arrival times of all stations

 the base time window needed around each arrival time and tpad is a
 necessary fudge factor to allow for errors in the predicted arrival time
 and extra time needed to remove filter endpoint transients.  
 The algorithm keys on a chan string to select data from the database.
 This can be applied in one of three ways.  First, a single channel
 code (e.g. BHZ) can be used, in which case only data matching that
 channel code will be returned.  Second, you can use a Datascope
 style regular expression for character strings.  e.g. ..Z would return
 all 3 character channel codes ending in Z.  Finally, you can use
 one of thee allowed single characters:  Z,N,E.  These are expanded
 to an expression match for all SEED channel codes matching that
 pattern including an expansion of Antelope style loc codes 
 (e.g. if you had BHZ, LHZ, HHZ, BHZ_00, and BHZ_01 at a station
 all five would be returned if you specify Z).

/*! \brief Assemble a gather with uniform sample rates.
 
 Takes an ensemble of data with potentially irregular sample
 rates and irregular start times and returns a gather with 
 uniform sample rates and in relative time reference frame
 defined by an input map.

 This is a relatively high level function to produce a data gather
 with three useful properties:  (1) all the data can be assumed to
 be at a common sample rate, although not on sample by sample
 common time base like multichannel data (i.e. t0 can vary at least
 within + or - one sample); (2) the input data are assumed on an
 absolute time base, but the output is in a relative time base with
 zero times defined by the StationTimes map object;  and (3) the 
 result is "clean" in the sense that one can assume all data are
 associated with a known station and were cleanly handled in the 
 processing to build this gather.  Clean, however, does NOT 
 mean that the data are gap free.  If there are marked data gaps
 in the raw data they will be quietly copied to the result and
 the user is expected to deal with them as appropriate for a given
 algorithm.  

  This function tries to catch any errors found in processing with
 the when in doubt throw it out attitude.  i.e. the result can be
 expected to frequently be smaller than then input.  Problems will
generally result in a spew of errors to stderr.

\param raw contains the base data.  It is assumed to be in an
  absolute time reference frame.  The metadata attributes  sta 
  and chan must be defined or this function will throw a MetadataError
  exception.
\param times is a map keyed by station.  It's contents are used to
  convert from absolute to relative time.  The most common example
  of this would be measured or predicted arrival times.  For this
  reason the results are written to the input and output gather
  as the field defined by the SeisppKeyword predicted_time_key.
\param phase is the phase name to be assigned to the predicted_time_key
  field.  See LoadPredictedArrivalTimes for how this is used.
\param result_twin is the time window definition for times
  relative to the times contained in the "times" StationTime object.
\param target_dt is the target sample rate for the output data.  All
  data returned will be sampled at this rate.
\param rsdef is the ResamplingDefinitions object passed to the
  resample function used to convert data to a common sample rate.
  see ResampleTimeSeries page or resample(3) for details.
\param trim is a boolean that controls edge transients in resampling.
  if true resample results will be truncated on the left and right
  to eliminate edge transients in using the FIR filters used for 
  decimation.

\exception throws a SeisppError if the resulting gather has no data
after resampling and windowing.

/*! \brief Aligns data by a metadata field time and resamples to a common 
sample interval.

This is a core, general method to return a gather that can be equivalenced
to a matrix.  That is, result has all data with common sample rate and
common time base.  i.e. dt, dt, and t0 are the same for all members of 
the output gather.  The input, in contrast, can be arbitrary irregular 
provided the algorithm can cut out and resample something that is 
rational.  
 
The algorithm usd is a cascade of two core algorithms in the SEISPP
library.  First, if the input trace does not have the same 
sample rate as target_dt the resample function is called on the entire
input trace to produce data sampled at target_dt.  The user should
be aware of this as for maximum efficiency the input should have just
enough padding to avoid transients from decimation filter edge effects.
Second, the resample data are changed from absolute to relative time
with time 0 of the new data defined by the time defined in a 
Metadata attribute fetched with key align_mdkey.  If align_mdkey 
is not defined for a given input trace this function will complain 
with a message to stderr and that data will be dropped from the 
output returned by this function.  The user should be aware that this
algorithm is actually very generic and can be applied to a wide
range of algorithms.  For example, it can be used for common source
gathers aligned by some predicted arrival time, common source gathers
aligned on measured arrival times, common receiver gathers with 
data aligned by measured arrival time, or CMP gathers aligned on
some arbitrary time base.  

\param raw contains the base data.  It is assumed to be in an
  absolute time reference frame.  
\param align_mdkey is a string key that MUST reference a real valued
  Metadata attribute that is to be used to define relative time on the 
  output.  That is, t0 of the output is result_twin.start with 0 defined
  relative to the time extracted from this key.
\param result_twin is the time window definition for times
  relative to the times contained in the "times" StationTime object.
\param target_dt is the target sample rate for the output data.  All
  data returned will be sampled at this rate.
\param rsdef is the ResamplingDefinitions object passed to the
  resample function used to convert data to a common sample rate.
  see ResampleTimeSeries page or resample(3) for details.
\param trim is a boolean that controls edge transients in resampling.

  decimation.

/*! \brief Read a block of three component data in a fixed time window.

 Reads a block of data defined by a time window derived from
 input specifications and a time range computed from a set of theoretical
 arrival times.  

 The algorithm used to define the time window is this:
 start = atmin + data_window.start - tpad while
 end = atmax + data_window.end + tpad.  In this relation atmin and

 The algorithm first calls the scalar ensemble function with the
 same name (array_get_data).  That routine reads all channels 
 within a specified time window.  To build three-component 
 objects these scalar time series data need to be bundled into
 threes to build the 3c object.  This is accomplished here through
 a special ThreeComponentChannelMap object that defines how this
 process should go.  The ThreeComponentChannelMap allows a heirarchy
 of channels that provide a way to sort out multiple data streams
 from the same station.  The ensemble that is returned by this
 function can have irregular sample rates so beware.

 Note the output of this function is sorted by sta.
