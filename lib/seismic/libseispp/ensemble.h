\brief Construct a ThreeComponentEnsemble from 
 database-indexed storage returning data defined by a fixed time window.
 `
 In processing continuous seismic data it is commonly necessary 
 to read data for an array of stations within a fixed time window.
 Many algorithms start this way and some assume data are already 
 on a common time base.  This constructor returns a vector of 
 ThreeComponentSeismogram objects spanning a constant time 
 defined by the TimeWindow argument.  i.e. all objects in
 the ensemble will have the same start time (t0).
 Metadata loaded are frozen as a set of names from the css3.0 attribute namespace.
 These are:  sta, time, samprate, and nsamp.   The following are translated from
 site to give receiver geographic location:  sta_lat, sta_lon, sta_elev, dnorth, deast, refsta.

 Calib from wfdisc is always applied.   Any data that do not join with site or sitechan 
 will be silently dropped.  The bundle process to build 3C sets is implemented by the
 helper procedure BundleChannels that is part of this library.   Most of the work of this
 constructor is done by calling the TimeSeriesEnsemble version with a similar argument signature
 and the BundleChannels procedure.

In plotting data it is frequently desirable to scale data by some

This is a generic algorithm to apply such an algorithm to an 
emsemble of data.  The approach is to assume the amplitude factor was
computed independently by some other method and set as the 
an attribute in the Metadata area of each member.  Thus this generic
algorithm assumes each member has inherited the Metadata object as 
a component of each member AND that each member of the ensemble is 
held in an STL vector container of Tmember objects.  

This algorithm silently skips data marked dead.  If a member does 
not have the amplitude attribute define this algorithm spits out 
an error to stderr and does nothing to the associated member.
This can cause downstream problems, but seems preferable to aborting.

/*! \brief Finds arrival time picks for a particular phase spanned by a seismogram.

In passive array processing a common thing one needs to do is associate a seismogram
with a measured arrival time for a particular phase.  This template does this 
for an ensemble of generic seismic data objects (ensemble) defined in this library.
The algorithm finds matching arrivals for a given phase in a database.  To make
the match it uses a time window driven by predicted arrivals.  The procedure finds
the time span defined by predicted arrivals in the data set given.  It does this by
requesting this attribute from each trace.  If the predicted arrival attribute is 
not define on any object in the ensemble and exception is thrown.  Otherwise the 
time interval used to find arrivals is the range of predicted arrivals extended
by tpad on both ends.  The procedure then initializes the arrival time attribute
field to a null value for all data members (live or dead).  It subsets the
database and then loads arrivals into each data member that match the phase
and time interval condition. 

\param d data ensemble to which this procedure is to be applied.
\param dbi generic database handle.  In this implementation this is immediately
	cast to a DatascopePointer.  Future work could make this more generic.
\param phase is the seismic phase for which an arrival time is to be loaded.
\param predarrkeyword is the predicted arrival time keyword used to fetch this
	attribute from each data member of the ensemble passed through d.
\param atkeyword is the arrival time keyworded used to load the arrival time
	into the Metadata of each member of the ensemble.  
\param tpad time padding around around time window computed from predicted arrival
	times stored with these data.
\param nullvalue is the value loaded as the arrival time when there is no entry 
	in the database for a data member.  This assures this attribute is set
	for all members.  This is useful, for example, to sort data.

for event (common source) gathers because it loads the source information

every member of the ensemble:  source_lat, source_lon, source_depth,
source_time, sta_lat, sta_lon, and sta_elev.  Note this algorithm
assumes the seispp convention that all angles in Metadata are stored
as degrees, NOT radians.

have valid results.  Specifically the predicted time result is posted
as 0 since a 0 epoch time is nonsense.

/*! Extract a component from a ThreeComponentEnsemble to yield a TimeSeriesEnsemble.

An ensemble of three component data can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional
array (3 by number of samples by number of ensemble members) while a TimeSeriesEnsemble
is effectively 2D (although implemented in a more general way in SEISPP).  
It is often useful to extract one of the components of a ThreeComponent data set
to yield a scalar (TimeSeriesEnsemble) result.  This procedure does this.

\param tcs input ensemble
\param component is data component to extract.  Must be 0,1, or 2 or the procedure
	will throw an exception.
\return auto_ptr to ensemble containing requested component

\exception SeisppError is throw if result is empty of component number is illegal.

/*! \brief Bundle scalar data to produce an ensemble of three-component data.

Data in many formats is stored raw a scalar, time series data.  A common issue 
is the need to bundle scalar component time series data into three-component 
seismogram object.   This is far from trivial with modern seismological data
due to the complexity created by multiple sensors and/or multiple samples
rates from the same physical point on the ground.   Another complexity is 
data irregularies - one or more components may be missing or dead in a particular
time period.   We handle that here through the StationChannelMap object.   

This algorithm here will discard data from any station from which it cannot 
assemble a set of 3 components that the StationChannelMap object says 
are rational to put together.   Here that means they must be from the
same sensor with a common sample rate, although the actual implementation 
uses user supplied definitions through the StationChannelMap object, 

A tacit assumption of the algorithm used is the input data are a block defined
either by event gathers or a common time window.   

\param  rawdata is the set input scalar data.  These data will be altered 
   on output as they will be sorted to sta-channel order.   

\param dtcs empty ThreeComponentEnsemble (i.e. members containers is assumed
zero length) to contain the bundled data.   User must copy ensemble Metadata
externally to this object if this is desired.  

\param scmap defines the mapping operator used for bundling.  See that objects
description for hints on how that works.

\exception - SeisppError will be thrown in fatal conditions.
