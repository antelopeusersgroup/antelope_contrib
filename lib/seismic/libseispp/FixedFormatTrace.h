/*! \brief Generic object that can be used to easily access seismic data
in a number of common external formats or user defined formats.

Most seismic data is stored externally in files with trace header
having a fixed set of attributes in specific spots.  Classic examples
are SEGY and SAC.  The object was designd to provide a common interface
into any seismic data format that is structured as a header in one
distinct binary block and data in another.  The concept used here is
to simply read the data in as a raw binary object and provide 
an series of indices into the the binary blob through the API.  

This object is also a low level interface for three component 
seismgrams stored with the same concept:  header followed by
data.  This is a low level interface because it assumes the data
are still stored as a vector of sample data.  An attribute is 
used to define the order of the sample data for this case.  
In the SEISPP library 3c data are abstracted as a 3xns matrix.
For a matrix the data can be stored in either column order 
(ala fortran) or in row order (ala C 2d arrays).  The interface
handles this through a public boolean attribute.  The constructors
set this when parsing the format description.  The most important
thing to reiterate is that the interface here will only view the
sample data as a vector of data.  The caller will in a higher 
level interface should simplify this user to build 3C data objects.
This was done intentionally to make this object more general.

The construction of one of these beasts is a bit unusual and 
worth noting up front.  Because the mapping operation of data
and trace attributes in formats like this is fixed, we don't 
want to rebuild the structure over and over again.  Hence the
normal usage is to call a simple constuctor that builds a skeleton
for the particular external format.  One then uses this skeleton
in secondary calls that have a FILE pointer as an argument.  
Reading then involves cloning the skeleton and filling in the
actual data with raw binary read (putting flesh on the bones).

	This constructor is used in two very different contexts.
	First, if one want to read a set of data in a specific
	format one should first call this constructor defaulting
	the nsamp parameter (zero value).  When nsamp is zero
	this contructor just builds the skeleton of the object
	with no data.  Later reads with a FILE parameter can be 
	used to load many traces without the overhead of building
	the complicated indices required when this particular
	constructor is called.

	The second use of this constructor is to build an empty 
	object of this type with a specified number of samples
	and all the attributes set to default values.  

	Note the both uses of this constructor hit a special parameter
	file that is assumed to have been installed in 
	the standard Antelope location for parameter files
	($ANTELOPE/data/pf).  The indexing for this particular
	format defined by the parameter passed as the argument type
	is defined in this parameter file.  This is a complicated
	parameter file with nested parameters.  Full description of
	it will wait until this code is in production form.  At 
	this writing it is experimental. 

	\param type data format name.  This name is used to search
	for a tag name in the parameter file that defines the
	layout of this particular data format.

	\param nsamp number of samples in data are to create for this 
	object.  If 0 (default) no data are is created and the 
	result can be used as a skeleton to efficiently clone objects
	of this type.
