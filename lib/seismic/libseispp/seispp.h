\brief Align an ensemble by a set of lag estimates.

We often want to shift the time base for a set of data in relative
time coordinates.  An example is application of statics of any kind.
Another is display of aligned traces after cross-correlation.  
This function handles this for any of the family of time series
ensemble objects.  It requires the input be in a relative time
reference frame to allow the application of the BasicTimeSeries
methods to deal with data gaps.  The basic algorithm is to 
get the original t0 time stamp (could be anything really, but 
the trefkeyword Metadata field must be set or an error will
follow), restore the data to an absolute time frame, shift
the original t0 shift value by lag extracted from the object
with the lagkey field, and then return the data to relative
time scale using the modified t0.  This algorithm retains the
integrity of the original absolute time stamp so the data are
altered in place.  This is in contrast to a similar template
function MoveoutTimeShift which is destructive.

On the flip side, the attribute defined by trefkeyword is incremented
by the extracted lag value.  This keeps this key attribute with the
0 time reference.  This is a design choice which causes the trefkeyword
value to be retained as a true time reference.

\param d input data ensemble of generic time series objects.
\param lagkey keyword used to extract the lag values from the 
	Metadata (generalized header) field of the ensemble members.
\param trefkeyword keyword used to extract the absolute time 0 stamp
	for each member of the ensemble.  This field is not altered 
	in the Metadata but is required to redefine t0 with an 
	applied lag value.

/*! \brief Test a generic time series object for sample rate match with standard.

With real data there is often an issue about the actual sample rate of data
versus the nominal sample rate.  e.g. in the resample procedures in the SEISPP
library it is necessary to ask this question as a trigger to know if data need
to be resample or not. The question is not just common, but prone to variations
because what is considered good enough is context dependent.  This template
regularizes this test for any time series object (child of BasicTimeSeries).
A default is used to allow for a fairly common standard so most applications
can drop the third argument for this litle procedure.  

The actual test is a simple fractional difference formula like percentage
error but not converted to percent (e.g. 10% here is 0.1).

\param seis generic time series whose sample interval is to be tested against standard.
\param target_dt standard sample interval for test
\param tolerance relative error tolerance (default 0.001)

// Convert a velocity model in flattened earth geometry to true geometry.
//
// Multiple programs exist in seismology that use a flattening transformation
// to convert spherical geometry into a regular grid.  The main reason
// for this in all examples I know of is to allow standard finite difference
// algorithms to used.  This is essential since standard finite differences
// demand regular grid geometries and the flattening transformation provides
// a convenient way to turn a spherical shell problem into a standard 
// finite different grid.  A GCLgrid3d object is aimed at getting the
// true geometry correct, however, so using velocity models defined on 
// a flattened coordinate system requires a conversion.  This function
// does this for a complete grid of points.  This algorithm assumes 
// a 3D model has been loaded into a GCLgrid3d object, BUT the coordinates
// and velocities stored in the grid have not been corrected by the
// inverse flattening transformation.  That is, the assumption is that
// the original model was defined in on flattened coordinate system but
// the points were converted to lat,lon, and (flattened) depth in building
// the input GCLscalarfield3d object.  The algorithm used here then just
// passes through the grid doing two things:  (1) the depth() method is 
// called for the parent grid and the uflatz (see gclgrid.h) function is
// called to convert this to true depth; and (2) the velocity value at each
// point is altered by in inverse flattening transformation.  Thus the 
// net effect is a depth dependent change in velocity values and a nonlinear
// distortion of the depth of each point in the grid.  
//
//\param vmodel is the parent grid.  It is altered in place to convert
//  flattened to true geometry as described above.
