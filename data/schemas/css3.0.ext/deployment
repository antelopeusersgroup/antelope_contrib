Attribute cert_time
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "epoch time" )
	Detail {
		Epochal time given as seconds and fractions of a second
		since hour 0 January 1, 1970, and stored in a double
		precision floating number.  Refers to the relation data
		object with which it is found.  E.g., in arrival - arrival
		time; in origin - origin time; in wfdisc, - start time of
		data.  Where date of historical events is known, time is
		set to the start time of that date; where the date of
		contemporary arrival measurements is known but no time is
		given, then the time attribute is set to the NA value. 
		The double-precision floating point number allows 15
		decimal digits.  At 1 millisecond accuracy this is a range
		of 3 years.  Where time is unknown, or prior to Feb.  10,
		1653, set to the NA value.

Attribute decert_time
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Epochal seconds" )
	Range ( "cert_time <= decert_time" )
	Description ( "last valid time for data" )
	Detail {
		In wfdisc, this attribute is the time of the last sample
		in the waveform file.  Endtime is equivalent to
		time+(nsamp-1)/samprate.  In sensor, this is the last time
		the data in the record are valid.
