### Object-Relational Mapping for Datascope

Contains basic functions to interact with (read) data from Antelope Datascope database tables into python using the Antelope Python API.

### Overview

* Dbrecord - A dictionary/object which loads/holds all the data from one record of a table. Field access as key or attribute.

* DbrecordList - A list of Dbrecord's. ALL data are local to python, in namespace and memory. You can close the db and your data remains. Memory hog if you pass it a huge table.

* DbrecordPtr - Object with the same methods/access as a Dbrecord, but the data are not local, they are read from/(AND WRITTEN TO) to the database. The pointer is stored and any fields are passed as queries to the db.

* DbrecordPtrList - A list of DbrecordPtr's. Suitable for most occasions. Because DbrecordLists can take up memory for a lot of records, see AttribDbptr.

* AttribDbptr - An 'Attribute pointer' which acts like a python list. Can be constructed with a Dbptr or a string db name. Instances consist of just one Dbptr in memory. DbrecordPtr's are built on the fly, and accessed as one would a list. AttribDbptr is also a generator, so one can run a for loop on it. A simple ORM for Datascope.

### Notes
Views are mostly supported. Access to the same fields from two joined tables may cause problems, depending on situation. Because all record pointers have attribute AND dictionary key access, in the 'pointer' classes (which use dbgetv directly), one can get access through the dictionary key: db['origin.time'], for example, of a joined view, while: db.origin.time will produce an error since 'origin' will produce a Dbptr which has no 'time' attribute.

### Examples
```python
>>> from antelope.datascope import dbopen
>>> from aug.contrib.orm import AttribDbptr
>>> db = dbopen('/opt/antelope/data/db/demo/demo')
>>> db = db.lookup(table='site')
```
Old way:
```python
>>> db.record = 5
>>> db
[0, 25, -501, 5]

>>> for db.record in range(db.nrecs()):
...     sta, lat, lon = db.getv('sta','lat','lon')
...     print sta, lat, lon
```
Using ORM:
```python
>>> sites = AttribDbptr(db)
>>> sites[5]
DbrecordPtr('site' -> OBN 1988258::-1)

>>> for s in sites:
...    print s.sta, s.lat, s.lon
