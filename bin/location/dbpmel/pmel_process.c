/* this is the main processing routine for dbpmel.  It takes an input
list of grid point, which are defined by integers gridid that are
passed through gridid_list, and processes data associated with each
of these grid points in sequence.   It uses datascope db manipulations
to form a view of arrivals associated with the current grid point 
and runs pmel against arrivals for that group of events.  Detailed
behaviour comes through a long list of options defined in the 
parameter file.  

Arguments:
	db - input db view of formed by a complex sequence (see below).
	gridlist - input Tbl list of gridids stored as pure
		integers in the Tbl.   i.e. they are extracted
		as gridid = (int)gettbl(...)
	pf - parameter space of options.  It is important that
		this pf object be checked with a routine that 
		verifies if key parameters are set using the function
		check_required_pf.  This is necessary because pf
		is accessed deep in this code to set check some
		of the many complex options.  This stops the program
		from aborting at inconvenient points within a 
		processing loop.

The view defined by db is very complicated.  This comment could go
out of data, but as of the date of initial writing the view was
formed by running dbprocess with this sequence:
        dbopen cluster
        dbjoin event
        dbjoin origin
        dbsubset orid==prefor
        dbjoin assoc
        dbjoin arrival
        dbjoin site
	dbjoin hypocentroid
        dbsort gridid evid

This is followed by a join with site using ondate:offdate keys to 
make the join work properly in varying station geometry.  A subset
by a sift key is also applied, but this should only reduce data not
alter the view.  The view is next sorted by the key
gridid:evid:sta:phase with a dbUNIQUE to prevent redundant picks on
multiple channels.
