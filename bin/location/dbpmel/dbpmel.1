.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBdbpmel\fR program is a relocation program based on the concept of
a multiple event location procedure.  It is designed mainly to relocate
entire catalogs, but it can be utilized for the more traditional role
of multiple event location procedures which is relocation of mainshock
aftershock sequences.  A multiple event location method assumes that
errors in the earth model can be absorbed into a set of simple 
time constants commonly called station corrections.  The \fBdbpmel\fR 
program implements an exact solution for this problem within the 
limitations of a linearization approximation.  That is, it solves
a matrix problem in which the data are the observed arrival times of an ensemble
of events and the unknowns are: (1) the location of all events in the 
ensemble and (2) a set of station corrections.  This approximation for
earth model errors is only valid for some limited region of space.  
How large that "limited region" is will generally be dependent on
where the sources were.  \fBdbpmel\fR aims to get around this limitation
by relocating entire catalogs grouped into ensembles by spatial position.
That is, the program is driven by associations of events into groups 
defined by a CSS3.0 extension table called "cluster".  This table defines
which events in a catalog are linked to a particular point in space.  
The outer loop of the program loops through all grid points relocating 
the events in each ensemble and estimating a set of station corrections
for that grid point.  
.LP
This program implements an algorithm described in two closely related
papers:  (1) Pavlis and Booker (1983) BSSA, pp.1753-1777; and (2) 
Pavlis and Hokanson (1985) JGR, pp. 12,777-12,789.  The 1983 paper
describes PMEL (Progressive Multiple Event Location) which was a name
used to distinguish it from Joint Hypocenter Decomposition.  The 
"progressive" was used to highlight the fact that a primary difference
between PMEL and JHD is that PMEL does iterative adjustments to the 
earthquake locations (the nonlinear parameters in the problem) while
JHD solves the entire problem in one large matrix inversion.  In
the 1985 paper we added the insight of using orthogonal projectors to
"separate" different components of the model error estimate.  The
projectors defined in that paper divide the model space into components
that can and cannot be determined from the data.  The parts that are
indeterminate from the data define a bias term that cannot be corrected
without auxiliary data.  This property is the primary innovation of
this program.  In \fBdbpmel\fR we allow the bias to be projected into 
the solution through the use of an auxiliary 3D reference model.  In 
this way unbiased estimates of travel time variations can be extracted
from the data but critical biases can be added back in (to correct for
absolute position) from an externally determined 3D reference model.  
This can be thought of as a way to utilize minimal information from a
3D reference model while extracting the maximum possible information
from the catalog times. 
.LP
This program is database driven.  The first thing it does is form 
an (often large) working view defined by the following join
.nf
cluster->event->origin->assoc->arrival
   A           B
.fi
where the -> is used to symbolize a database join operation and A and B
are modifiers (standard notation doesn't translate to a man page).  
The A modifier here means that when the cluster table is accessed it is
subsetted to only contain grid index values that the program was 
instructed to process (see the gridlist option description below).  The 
B modifier refers to a (standard) modifier for the event to origin 
join where the view is subsetted to make the join one-to-one 
("orid==prefor" in Antelope syntax).  Once this view is formed the 
processing is completely driven by this virtual table.  
Each ensemble defined by a common "gridid" attribute in the cluster
table is processed as a group.  The resulting solution is then saved
to two output tables called "gridstat" and "gridscor", which are 
extension tables to CSS3.0 defined in genloc1.1. 
The "gridstat" table stores summary 
statistical data for each grid point.  The "gridscor" table stores the
station correction estimates keyed by gridid:sta:phase.  
.LP
The program has a lot of options that can be set at run time through
the input parameter file.  These are described below.    
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fBgridlist\fP argument is a comma separated list of gridid (integers) 
to be processed in this run.  Ranges of integers can be specified with two
integers separated by the - symbol.  Multiple ranges can be specified and 
mixed with simple numbers.  e.g. if gridlist is the string
"1,5,500-5000,8000-10000"  dbpmel will process grid points defined by gridid
of 1, 5, the range 500 to 5000, and the range 8000 to 10000.  Be warned that
the working database view is formed by the outer range of this list so for 
the example above, the database would be subsetted to include all grid ids from 
1 to 10000.  It would, however, only process the grid points specified.  
.LP
The \fB-pf\fR flag is used to specify an alternative parameter file to the 
stock one based on the name (i.e. dbpmel.pf).  
.SH PARALLEL PROCESSING IMPLEMENTATION
.LP
Because this program has been found to run for days on the fastest computers
around attempts have been made to apply parallel processing techniques to 
reduce run times to more useful scales.  The program has been parallelized
at the outer loop level (over gridid) using MPI (Message Passing Interface).  
For reference we achieved about a 12 fold reduction in wall clock time on 
a 16 processor system with the MPI implementation.  Be aware, however, that
the binary of this program distributed with Antelope and that produced by
the default Makefile found in the source code do not utilize MPI.
You will need to modify the Makefile and recompile the
source code to get the parallel processing version of dbpmel.  
The Makefile has commented out lines that can be restored to guide you.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fBdbpmel\fR has a large (perhaps excessive) number of configurable
parameters.  A large number of them are inherited from genloc.  That is
dbpmel uses the same location engine as dbgenloc.  Thus the user is referred
to dbgenloc(1), genloc(3), and genloc_intro(3) for generic location parameters
that are also shared by dbpmel.  
.LP
The following are major control parameters for dbpmel.  They are grouped in 
categories defined by headings.  
.ce
\fBTravel Times\fR
.LP
\fBtravel_time_model\fR and \fB3Dreference_model\fR specify travel time 
handle definitions in the same vein as dbgenloc.  That is, these parameters 
refer to a parameter file located relative to $ANTELOPE/data/tables/genloc.
For example, taup/iasp91 would define travel times using the recipe
defined in the file $ANTELOPE/data/tables/genloc/taup/iasp91.pf.  The
\fBtravel_time_model\fR parameter defines the calculators used internally as
a reference model for most travel time calculations.  The calculation
methods defined by \fB3Dreference_model\fR are used to compute the bias
terms as the difference between travel times computed from this model and 
that computed by \fBtravel_time_model\fR.  To produce an unbiased estimate
simply use the same name for these two parameters and the computed
corrections will be zero.  
.ce
\fBStation/phase control\fR
.LP
Stations information is read from the database.  To use every station in
the input database set the boolean parameter \fBuse_all_stations\fR to true.
It is sometimes desirable to not use the full station list.  To do this
set \fBuse_all_stations\fR false and provide a list with the parameter
\fRpmel_stations\fR (an &Tbl parameter). Because this program aims for
high precision it tries to make up for a format deficiency in the site
table.  That is, the lat and lon attributes are only defined to 32 bit
precision which has lower precision than is routinely possible with 
GPS locations.  If the boolean parameter \fBuse_dnorth_deast\fR is
set true values stored in the dnorth and deast attributes of the
site table will be treated as corrections to be added to the point
defined in the lat and lon attributes.  WARNING: dnorth and deast 
are used for an entirely different purpose by some other programs.
dbap(1) and mwap (1) use these fields for computing plane wave delays.
If these fields have been set by the setdne(1) program the internal
geometry used by dbpmel may be vastly distorted.  For this reason
this parameter should normally be set false.
.LP
Which phases to use are controlled explicitly through a list (&Tbl) 
defined by the parameter \fBphases_to_use\fP.  It is also implicitly
controlled by what phases you define with valid travel time 
calculator descriptions (see above).  Having more travel times 
defined than used by pmel is considered normal.  If phases_to_use
contains a phase that is not defined a large cascade of errors will
follow and dbpmel may or may not abort.  
.ce
\fBPMEL control parameters\fR
.LP
The location procedure does an iterative adjustment to locations and a
set of station correction estimates.  Truncation of the hypocenter iterations
are controlled by genloc parameters described in genloc_intro(3).  The 
station correction loop truncation is controlled by two parameters.
The loop can terminate on count as defined by the parameter 
\fBpmel_maximum_sc_iterations\fR.  When the loop is truncated on count
an error message is written to the log file.  Normal truncation is 
controlled by the parameter \fBpmel_sc_fraction_convergence_error\fR.
.LP
How the inverse for the station corrections is computed is controlled by
two parameters:  \fBpmel_svd_relative_cutoff\fR and \fBpmel_cluster_mode\fR.
This implementation of PMEL always uses a pseudoinverse to invert the 
matrix solved for station correction estimates.  \fBpmel_svd_relative_cutoff\fR
defines the singular value cutoff used for constructing this inverse.
Note it is a relative cutoff which means the actual cutoff is defined 
as the largest singular value of the matrix times this value.  
The \fBpmel_cluster_mode\fR parameter is more subtle.  When this boolean is
set true events are relocated normally, but when forming the parameter 
separation projectors the partial derivatives are computed using the 
position defined by the hypocentroid NOT the actual location of the event.
This mode is recommended when run in the 3D grid mode provided the 
grid association forces the associations to reasonably small volumes.
If events are too widely spread around the hypocentroid this approximation
is clearly poor.  The reason this feature is used is that it removes 
ambiguities in the projectors defined in the Pavlis and Hokanson paper.
The reasons for this are described in that paper. The key point is that
for normal use this parameter should be true.  It should be turned off
for a traditional JHD type solution.  A final side issue on the inversion
is important.  The input parameter to genloc called \fBgeneralized_inverse\fR
MUST be set to "pseudoinverse" or dbpmel will issue a diagnostic and terminate
execution immediately.  This was done because the damped least-squares 
solution can artificially stabilize poorly constrained solutions and produce
incorrect solutions.  As a result the program forces a pseudoinverse solution
to avoid this problem.
.LP
Six different parameters control the handling of outliers:  
\fBpmel_initial_error_scale, pmel_minimum_error_scale,
pmel_minimum_sswrodgf, pmel_F_test_critical_value,
pmel_autodelete_high_rms\fR and
\fBpmel_svd_relative_cutoff\fR.  The pmel implementation used here
handles problem data with a dual weighting and outlier detector.
First, it implicitly uses the residual weighting scheme of genloc
whenever it is turned on (see genloc_intro(3)).  A major variant, 
however, is that the error scale used to define outliers is not
determined independently for each event (the normal procedure
for dbgenloc), but is derived from the global rms figure for each
ensemble.  This should normally provide a more stable measure since
it is a statistic that by definition has more degrees of freedom than
that from a single event.  Three parameters define how this error
scale is handled:  \fBpmel_initial_error_scale, pmel_minimum_error_scale,\fR
and \fBpmel_minimum_sswrodgf\fR.  As the names should imply the first sets
the starting value of the error scale for the initial pass when rms 
statistics are not normally available.  The second two are used to 
prevent the common problem of M-estimators.  That is, the error scale
needs to have a floor to prevent a downward spiral of continuous 
downweighting until all weights go to zero.  The defaults should
normally work, but if you observe large number of zero weights in the
output assoc table these numbers should be made larger.
.LP
\fBpmel_F_test_critical_value\fR and \fBpmel_autodelete_high_rms\fR
are tightly coupled.  The first is ignored unless the second (boolean)
is set true.  When true a second level outlier detector is enabled 
on an event basis.  That is, a single bad pick (or a small number 
among many) can normally be handled well by residual weighting.  
Multiple bad picks or an event that is inconsistent with the rest of
the ensemble will yield an elevated overall rms statistic relative to
the ensemble.  When this feature is enabled the rms of each event is
compared to the global average (this is properly corrected by 
removing each event from the global rms figure before doing the 
test) using an F-test. \fBpmel_F_test_critical_value\fR controls 
the critical value used to throw out events with high rms relative
to the ensemble average.   
.ce
\fBLabelling Parameters\fR
.LP
dbpmel stores a record of the parameter space it ran under in the
directory \fBpmelrun_archive_directory\fR with a file name defined
by \fBpmel_run_name\fR (a ".pf" is appended to this string).  
Note that this information is stored in an extension table defined
in genloc1.1 called "pmelruns".  
.LP
The parameter \fBgridname\fR defines the grid name used to define
the cluster table.  The program will abort if no matching attribute
by this name is found in the cluster table.  (This is present to allow
multiple clustering sets to be defined on the same catalog.)  
.LP
The \fBauthor\fR parameter is used to set the auth field in the output
origin table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IP (1) 
On large catalogs the database view can very quickly get overwhelming.  I have
seen this program fail multiple times trying to simply allocate memory to 
build the working view. If this happens use the \fBgridlist\fR argument to limit
the view to a smaller region and run the program multiple times for the different,
sequential gridid.  e.g. if you had a grid with 10000 grid points you could run
the program 10 times (on 10 machines if you had them available) in blocks of 
1000.  
.IP (2)
This program can and has run for days on large catalogs.  The process is automatically
checkpointed because it works through the catalog sequentially by gridid. That is,
if the program dies or has to be aborted during a run, check the last line of the
gridstat table or the log file for the last gridid processed.
.IP (3)
The parallel processing implementation with MPI works but was done after the fact 
leading to design problems.  It is only known to work on shared memory machines 
(i.e. Sun Enterprise machines) and running it on a linux cluster is virgin 
territory.  Users interested in a parallel processing implementation should
contact the author as a redesigned implementation is under development 
that uses a completely different data flow model than dbpmel.
.IP (4)
The pmel_run_name parameter must be specified uniquely for each run.  This gets
extremely annoying if you have to run in a batch environment because the program
will abort when it finds the name has already been used. The name should probably
be a random file name generated by some mechanism to assure it is unique.
