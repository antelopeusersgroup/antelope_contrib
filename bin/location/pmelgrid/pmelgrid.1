.SH NAME
pmelgrid - data driven processing module for PMEL catalog relocation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
pmelgrid db pfistream pfostream [-pf file -V]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpmelgrid\fR program is designed to relocate events in
a catalog using the method called Progressive Multiple Event
Location (PMEL).  It uses the same internal algorithm as
a closely related program called dbpmel(1).  
(The user is referred to the man page for dbpmel for more
fundamentals of the algorithm.)  The control pf
files are, in fact, identical.  The only differences is
the way pmelgrid handles input data compared to dbpmel.
The dbpmel program reads directly from a database while
pmelgrid reads data from a pfstream(5).  
.LP
The reason pmelgrid was written as an alternative to dbpmel
was that dbpmel has serious performance problems on large
databases.  Databases with the order of 0.5 to 2 million arrivals
are common.  With large databases dbpmel became completely io 
bound with most of the wall time spent on database updates.  
Because processing a large catalog with dbpmel took weeks of
time the io system used to feed the computing modules internal
to the program was completely changed.  The result is pmelgrid.
.LP
The io approach in pmelgrid is completely data driven and centered
on a library called libpfstream.  A pfstream(5) is a way
to encapsulate rows of a database into a stream format in a general
way.  It is used in pmelgrid as a transport mechanism for data in
and out of the main processing loop.  A user of this program will
hopefully not need to care about the actual format until a problem
develops.  This program is multithreaded.  A read and write thread
are spawned whose only role is to handle data input and output
data.  Both read and write threads use BRTT's pmtfifo to allow
the processing loop to quickly move data in and off of the queues
to reduce io wait times.  The pmtfifo queues are mutex protected 
making this approach feasible.  
.LP
If \fIpmelgrid\fR is to be run in a multiprocessor environment 
on a shared memory system (e.g. Sun Enterprise servers), it can
and should be compiled with MPI.  When compiled with MPI the 
execution time on a parallel system should approach a linear 
speedup. (i.e. if N processors are available the 
execution speed should be roughly N times faster or execution 
time should be reduced by approximately 1/N.)  
Note that the mechanism used by the current implementation 
will NOT work with MPI on a distributed memory machine.  
A distributed memory interface is under development and should
be completed by summer 2003.  
.LP
The program requires three arguments.  
\fIdb\fR is the parent database.  The only table it references is
the site table and (when defined) the timing table.  Data flow in
through \fIpfistream\fR and out through \fIpfostream\fR.  
\fIpfistream\fR and \fIpfostream\fR can be regular files, but 
the expectation is that they would normally be a fifo created with
the mkfifo(1) command.  The input stream should be connected to 
the output of db2pfstream(1) and the output should normally be
connected to the input of pfstream2db(1).  
With this mechanism a typical run would be
something like this:
.nf
mkfifo pfi
mkfifo pfo
db2pfstream anza pfi &
pfstream2db pfo new &
pmelgrid anza pfi pfo
.fi
.LP
where in this example pfi is the input stream to pmelgrid and 
pfo is the output stream from pmelgrid.  
.LP
In initial testing it may be wise to use regular files instead of a fifo,
but for large catalogs the pfstream files can get huge very fast.  
Be aware that if a regular file is used for output you will need to 
create an empty file with touch(1) before running pmelgrid or it
will abort with a diagnostic.  
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -pf
Use file instead of default parameter file named "pmelgrid.pf".  Note
the usual antelope pf rule that "file" should not contain the ".pf" 
extension.  
.IP -V
Prints a usage line and exits.  
.SH FILES
.LP
Input and output are all through pfstream files described in pfstream(5).
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
See dbpmel(1).  All options are identical.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are logged with the elog facility.  
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
dbpmel(1), pfstream2db(1), db2pfstream(1), pfstream(5)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IP (1)
The current version has not been extensively tested with MPI.  Use
at your own risk unless you ask the author about status.
.IP (2)
The MPI interface may change drastically.  We are aiming to make
the shared memory and distributed memory versions of the program
identical at the source code level so the internal algorithm does
not need to be altered for different systems.  
.IP (3)
The input and output fifo's could, perhaps, have been done through
stdin and stdout but it was my judgement that this avoided a lot of
potential problems with extraneous error messages accidentally getting
entrained in the pfstream files.  This could cause nasty errors 
that would be hard to track down or recreate.
