.TH DATASCOPE_SCHEMA 1
.SH NAME
Datascope_schema - creates pf file needed for MsPASS import/export
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Datascope_schema [-pf pffile] [-t t1 t2 ...]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This command line tool is used to distill the large content of the 
css3.0 schema file to reduced content that is stored in a 
parameter file that is the primary output.   
The default file is called "Datascope_schema.pf" but that name 
can be changed with the -pf argument.  That parameter file is 
used by import/export functions in the new, open-source waveform 
processing package called MsPASS 
(Massively Parallel Analysis System for Seismology).   
MsPASS is compatible with Antelope and can be downloaded as an 
anaconda package, a docker container, or cloning the source 
code from github.   Consult the documentation for MsPASS found 
at http://www.mspass.org/ for functionality of the package and 
more on installation options.  
.LP
This command tool is a complement to a python class in MsPASS 
called "DatascopeDatabase".   The constructor for a
DatascopeDatabase object requires a version of the output of this 
program to build the data structures used to translate the flat file
format of Datascope to and from a pandas DataFrame.   
This program is in antelope contrib instead of MsPASS because it 
depends completely on the python bindings in Antelope to the 
datascope API.   
.LP
A KEY POINT is the few users will ever need to use this program. 
It exists strictly to produce alternative pf files to use 
with MsPASS.  The only reason that would be necessary is if 
one needed a table not defined in the default MsPASS version of 
the pf.   That file does not include all css3.0 tables so if you 
need an obscure table converted you may need to use this program.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -pf
Write to alternative file "pffile" instead of default 
DatascopeDatabase.pf.
.IP -t
Provide an alternative list of tables (t1 t2 ...) 
to write in the output pf.  See the actual python code for this 
tool for the (long) list of the default.  If a new table is 
needed I would recommend just listing the needed table 
in a run line and then merging the output with the master 
pf file in the MsPASS distribution.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The current version only works with css3.0.  If you need to 
run this with an alternative schema, be aware this is a pure 
python script so it is relatively easy to simply edit the script 
to define the schema the code should use.
