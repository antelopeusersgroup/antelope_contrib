.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBdb2ims\fP looks at a css3.0 \fIdatabase\fP and summarizes event and phase
information in the DMC short IMS 2.0 bulletin format.  The output of the program
is a text file that should be sent to the DMC.  Use the \fBims2dmc\fP script to
send the output file from \fBdb2ims\fP to the DMC and to track it in a
dmcbull table.

.LP

\fBdb2ims\fP requires the following database tables:  arrival, assoc, origin,
origerr, event, and snetsta.  The netmag and stamag tables are use if available.
 The input \fIdatabase\fP should pass dbverify origin, assoc 
and event checks cleanly.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pf"
Name of parameter file (default is \fBdb2ims\fP.\fIpf\fP)
.IP "-P project"
Project name that will be placed in the output file name.  
To be used if one \fIagency\fP is producing more than one 
set of phase picks.  For instance, the ANF has produced phase picks from
separate databases for both the \fIusarray\fP and \fIceusn\fP projects:  
without a \fIproject\fP appended to the filename, there is no distinguishing
which input \fIdatabase\fP was used.  This has led to confusion for agencies 
like the ISC which collects the produced files from the DMC. 
Note that the combined default file name plus this project must be less
than 32 characters in order to fit within the max characters for \fIdfile\fP.
.IP -v
Verbose log messages
.IP -V
Overwhelmingly verbose log messages.  Useful for debugging purposes only.
.IP -y
Only select reviewed origins.  This is probably the preferred mode of operations.  
Any origins which do not have the review field in the origin changed to "y" are 
not included.  Note that for a real-time system where you have an analyst 
reviewing the database with dbloc2 (changing the review field to "y") 
and new external bulletins associated and chosen as prefor 
(with dborigin2orb/orb2dbt), you can get an origin that is chosen as
the prefor, but not marked as reviewed.  Events that fall into this category 
are skipped and not reported in the output file despite having one solution/origin
that is marked as reviewed.  ALL solutions must be marked as reviewed for the
event to be included in the output file.
.IP -a
Send all associated origins, not just the \fIprefor\fP and the \fImag_origin_auth\fP 
in the pf file.  Beware that this may cause significant heartburn if you are sending 
data to the IRIS DMC as they have limited capacity to receive all the origin data.
.IP "-s start_time"
Select origins after this time.
.IP "-e end_time"
Exclude origins after this time.
.IP "-t lddate"
Exclude origins with lddate before this time.
.IP "-l logfile"
Output file.  The default format is:  $year_$month_$day_$agency_IMS.  
The year, month, and day are determined by the first event in the 
subsetted \fIdatabase\fP.  The agency is determined from the parameter file.
If a \fIproject\fP is requested with the \fI-P\fP option, the file name will
look like $year_$month_$day_$agency_$project_IMS and will need to be less than
32 characters.
.IP "-d database"
This is the database which contains the dmcbull table.  The dmcbull table
tracks the output files created by this program that have been sent to the
IRIS DMC.  By choosing this option, the dfile field of the dmcbull table
is checked to make sure there are no duplicate output filenames.  If there
are duplicates, the output file is renamed by appending an index (.1, .2, etc.).
See ims2dmc(1) or dmcbull(5) for additional information on the dmcbull table.  This 
optionally specified database can be the same or different from the database containing
arrival, assoc, origin, and event information. 
for input
.IP database
Name of input \fIdatabase\fP.  The arrival, assoc, origin, event, snetsta 
and origerr tables are required.  This is required and can be the same name or 
different from the database specified with the -d option.
.SH FILES
.SS "General format information"
The format of the output file is a modification of the IMS1.0 short format.  Documentation
of the format for the various blocks is available from pages 163-170 of the ISF/IMS1.0 document pages.

.SS "DMC specific information"
Modifications by the DMC include:

(1) The IRIS/FDSN specific "Formatted Agency Comment" is defined as a Formatted
Comment (see below) with the following key/value pair: AGENCY="xx" describing
the agency submitting the Bulletin.  For example:

 (IRIS AGENCY="University of Washington")

(2) The "Phase Information Sub-block" is defined in the ISF extensions document
starting on page 16 (link to document below).

(3) The IRIS/FDSN specific "Phase Information Sub-block Formatted Comments" are
defined as Formatted Comments (see below) with the following key/value pairs:

FDSNNETWORKCODE="xx" :: FDSN Network code associated with the picked waveform.
FDSNLOCATIONID="xx" :: FDSN Location ID associated with the picked waveform.
FDSNQUALITYCODE="x" :: FDSN data quality code (D, R, Q, etc.)

The FDSN network code is required, the location id and quality code are assumed
to be unknown if not present.

For example:

 (IRIS FDSNNETWORKCODE="II" FDSNLOCATIONID="  ")
or
 (IRIS FDSNNETWORKCODE="IU" FDSNLOCATIONID="00" FDSNQUALITYCODE="R")

Formatted Comments:
IRIS specific Formatted Comments using the IMS1.0 comment syntax are formatted
beginning with an open, round bracket "(" at position 2 in the record/line,
followed "IRIS", followed by key and (quoted) value pairs and ending with a
closed, round bracket ")".  A comment line should not be longer than 120
characters.

For data submitted to the DMC the station code (Phase Block), channel code
(Phase Information Sub-block), and Formatted Comment keys: FDSNNETWORKCODE,
FDSNLOCATIONID and FDSNQUALITYCODE should all follow the SEED/FDSN naming
nomenclature and uniquely identify the waveform associated with the phase
arrival.

.SS "General information"
The output file is divided into three sections (four if a magnitude block is
requested):  1) EVENT HEADER and DATA; 2) MAGNITUDE HEADER AND DATA; 3) PHASE 
HEADER and DATA; and 4) PHASE SUB-BLOCK HEADER and DATA.

The first line of the file must be, "DATA_TYPE BULLETIN IMS1.0:short".  It is followed
by EVENT HEADER information which describes the event number, and region where the
earthquake occurred.  The EVENT DATA block contains the time, location, and depth of
the earthquake as well as error ellipse information.  Note that in most circumstances,
no error ellipse information is available for origins that were collected from regional
network operators (i.e. you may only have this information for origins that were produced
with dblocsat or dbgenloc).  Please see the /fImatch_origerr_auth/fP parameter in the PARAMETER
FILE section below.  An indication of what the analysts chose as the preferred solution is 
indicated with a comment of /fI#PRIME/fP.

The second section, optionally included when the -m option is selected, contains 
magnitude information.  After the header line, the data section contains the magnitude 
type, network magnitude value, magnitude error, number of stations used to calculate
the network magnitude, the organization publishing the magnitude ane the origin ID.  The
IMS format allows for the inclusion of a "min-max indicator" which would be displayed to
the immediate right of the magnitude value as either a "<" or ">".  As the css3.0 schema
does not track this type of parameter, /fBdb2ims/fP hardcodes this to a blank.  Only magnitudes
which match the /fImatch_mag_auth/fP and /fImatch_mag_type/fP from the parameter file and
have non-null values are reported.  

The third section (second if -m is not selected) contains phase information.  It lists 
the station code, the distance
from the event, the station to event azimuth, the phase (as picked by the analyst),
arrival time, residual of the pick, azimuthal direction, and if available, the signal-to-noise
ratio, amplitude, and period.  Magnitude information is filled in if the preferred origin, indicated
with a ("PRIME") comment in section 1 with the EVENT DATA, matches the /fImatch_mag_auth/fP parameter.  
See PARAMETER FILE section below.

The final section contains additional phase information.  It lists the SEED net code,
the channel code, phase (as picked by the analyst), the date, error in arrival time
as determined by the analyst, and author of the pick..

Each section also has either an event, origin, or arrival id.  These ids should be
considered subject to change and should not be relied upon.  ID references for
external bulletins may not be the same as those used by that institution.

.IP \fIagency\fP
This is the short name for the reporting agency.  The output file format requires
this to be 8 characters or less.  Check with the DMC so that your agency is recognized.
.IP \fIauthor_reject\fP
This is used to reject certain authors from the output file.  The subset
that is performed is "auth!~/$author_reject/".  Use this to remove automatic solutions,
or others that you do not want reported.
.IP \fImatch_origerr_auth\fP
Use this to select from which authors to attempt to find origerr information.  If this
is not used, the Smaj, Smin, Az, etc. may not be filled in properly (or with proper
blanks).
.IP \fIims_dir\fP
This is a directory where the output files are stored.  Directory is created if
it does not already exist.  This string is used in the 'dir' field of the 
dmcbull table when \fIims2dmc\fP is run. 
.IP \fIaccept_magtype\fP
List of magnitude types to report in magnitude block if the -m option is chosen.
.IP \fImag_origin_auth\fP
List of origin.auth values to report in magnitude block if the -m option is chosen.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This has not been tested outside of the ANF.  I suspect that there may
be some modifications needed for translation of other external bulletins.
Any updates to naming conventions or additional external bulletins will 
have to be coordinated with the DMC: current contact is Chad 
Trebant (chad@iris.washington.edu).

The eTime field in the phase sub-block is currently filled in with the
deltim value.  This is probably a bad choice as deltim is an arbitrary value
chosen by the analyst and is filled in with a weighting factor by some
automatic location programs.

Earlier versions of this output format made no distinction as to what the 
preferred origin was.  As of late April 2008, the DMC has agreed that adding 
a comment (#PRIME) after the preferred origin in the ORIGIN block is an 
acceptable way to indicate the preferred origin.  The preferred origin is 
used to calculate values placed in the phase/arrival blocks, so having some
indication is rather important and was a significant drawback for earlier 
files.  I do not have a way to convert files generated without this indication
to the new format.  You could go back to the css tables and attempt to figure
it out.  However, re-running with the newer version of this script is 
probably the best solution.

I have no control over the requirements of the output format.  Any concerns
or questions should be directed elsewhere.

Magnitude values in the phase block are only reported when the preferred 
author (#PRIME location) is the \fImag_origin_auth\fP.  

Tracking what files are created and have been sent to the DMC is critical.
Make sure that you follow up IMS file creation with ims2dmc program in your 
processing routines.  You will then have a record of the files you create
stored in a dmcbull extension table.  The ims2dmc program will also track
files transfered via orbxfer (-o option for ims2dmc) in a dmcfiles table.
