.TH EVENT2QML 1

.SH NAME
event2qml \- export CSS3.0 events to QuakeML format

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBevent2qml\fR [-v] [-d] [-p parameter_file] [-o output_file] database EVID
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Export a particular EVID from an CSS3.0 database and output all associated information, to
a file or STDOUT, in QuakeML format. This includes all Origins, Associations, Arrivals,
Detections, MomentTensors, FocalMechanisms, Magnitudes, and StationMagnitudes. We avoid
any waveform measurements, exported into Amplitude elements, until we can develop a method
for linking the entries in the wfmeas table to only one ORID in the list.

QuakeML is an XML representation of seismological data. Intended to standardize seismological
data exchange. A basic outline of the general concept of QuakeML can be found in
Schorlemmer et al. (2004). Other online references:
    https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml
    https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/quakeml.php

This version was intended for exchanging parametric data between ANSS networks,
IRIS and other international partners. The specifics on ANSS Quakeml Standards can be
found on https://github.com/usgs/Quakeml/wiki/ANSS-Quakeml-Standards-Working-Group-Project-Brief
With that in mind we try to match the specifics stated in the ANSS-Quakeml-Standards and avoid
some of the suggestions listed in the official documentation:
    QuakeMLâ€”An XML Representation of Seismological Data Basic Event Description
    Version 1.2
    Recommendation 14 February 2013
On the other hand, the code will validate your output against the RelaxNG description of
QuakeML-1.2.rng distributed in that same document and everything should pass.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-o\fR output_file.xml"
Export the information to this file.
 
.IP \fB-v\fR
Run in verbose mode.
 
.IP \fB-d\fR
Debug mode.
 
.IP "\fB-p\fR pf_file"
Parameter file to use.

.SH EXAMPLE
Example 1 is to export an event to STDOUT for the user to read the information.
.nf
    event2qml -v /opt/antelope/data/db/demo/demo 15
.fi

Example 2 is the same event but piping the output to a file by hand.
.nf
    event2qml -v /opt/antelope/data/db/demo/demo 15 > demo_event.txt
.fi

Example 3 is to save the event to file directly
.nf
    event2qml -v -o demo_event.txt /opt/antelope/data/db/demo/demo 15
.fi

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The output is not including any amplitude measurements in this version. The rest
of the QuakeML structure shoul be there. You should not see any "amplitude"
elements and no "stationMagnitudeContribution" in this version.

The RealTime version of the Basic Event Description is coded in this version
but no methods are provided for you to use it since all interaction is
limited to the database. You always know the EVID linked to all of the
information that your are exporting.
