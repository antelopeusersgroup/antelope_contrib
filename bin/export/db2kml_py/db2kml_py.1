.TH DB2KML_PY 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
db2kml_py \- pretty-print station and/or origin data as KML or KMZ
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2kml_py \fP[-vxt] [-p pf_file] dbname
.fi
.SH SUPPORT

.SH DESCRIPTION

This text is grabbed pretty much verbatim from the db2kml manpage
with a few changes when needed.

\fBdb2kml_py\fP prints a file of placemarks in kml
(Keyhole Markup Language) suitable for Google Earth and a growing
number of other programs. The placemarks can be for origin or site
information extracted from the specified database.

In GE, each event will display its magnitude and date when moused
over. Selecting the event will bring up a menu with more detailed
information. Each point is also tagged with a kml <TimeStamp> tag.
In recent versions of Google Earth (> v4.0) it is possible to "play"
the events in time using the time slider bar. The time slider bar
can also be used to adjust the start and end dates of the events
being displayed. There is no limit on the number of sites or events
that can be processed, however at present GE bogs down on more than
a few thousand aplacemarks.

The icons for the placemarks and the depth-magnitude scale must
reside in a web accessible location. A provisional location is
included in the parameter file though users are encouraged to modify
this for any heavy use.  Please read the note about servers below.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP -v
verbose output

.IP -x
debug aka very verbose output

.IP -t
file type to output - not currently implemented

.IP "-p pf_file"
use pf_file instead of the default pf file.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
The parameter file contains many more variables than currently 
available in db2kml. These various parameters allow the user 
to customize the metadata and output for their institution. 
The user can also define complex Datascope expressions for 
getting just the view they want. You can also choose to output 
a kmz file (compressed kml) rather than kml if desired, and define 
a network link if the kml source will update automatically and 
you want users of your file to have their content auto-update over 
the network.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBdb2kml_py\fP exits with 0 upon success, nonzero upon error.

.SH NOTE ABOUT SERVERS
The icons and the magnitude/depth legend must be sourced from a
web-accessible location. Especially if your KML files are served
to a wide audience, it is important to provide a robust archive for
these images that you have control over. To do this, copy the
following images to a web accessible directory on your own server:

.SH REAL TIME UPDATES
Define a network link variable in the parameter file
