.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrsync_baler\fP is designed to create and maintain a local archive 
of miniseed files from balers with ftp and http access (Baler44).
The script will get the list of active stations and IPs from a database. 
The required tables are deployment, stabaler and staq330 from a css3.0 database.
After creating the list of targets the script will spawn multiple copies
of itself to connect to each station and download the data.
Each child will connect to a single station and a single directory archive.
Multiple connection utilities are used during the retrieval process. 
The list in order is:
.TP 
.B http   =>  LWP, wget, curl, lynx
.LP
.TP 
.B ftp    =>  LWP, Net::FTP, wget, curl, ncftp, ftp
.LP

.PP 
The default mode for the script is archival. In this mode the system will connect 
to the stations and will download as many files as possible the the allowed time
(set in the parameter file). The downloads are done in alphabetical order. 
.LP
.PP 
A second mode is to run the script with the -R or -j flags. This will produce reports 
for the databases present in the main directory. A list of stations is produce from
the database before looking into the folders. If running with the -j flag the report will
get dump into the specified file as a JSON formatted object. 
.LP
.PP 
A third option is to run with the -x flag to review every entry on the databases and fix
any errors. Each file in the directory that does not match the name of the file gets thrown
into a trash folder in the archive. The rest of the files in the folder are verified on 
the database. If missing from the database with an entry in the status field of "downloaded" 
then one is created for it. Then the script verifies every entry on the database with status 
"downloaded" and checks for the file in the directory. The the script verifies that every file 
contains a checksum. If missing one then the system will try to get the respective checksum
file and will update the table with the results. If we have a success match then the value
of the checksum gets updated on the table. If the file is missing then we have the word 
"missing" on the database. If there is an error then we have "error-verify" on the database.
.LP
.PP 
If the file is missing in the directory the entry on the database with value "downloaded"
gets deleted.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v

.IP -s

.IP "-j file.json" 
Run report mode and export table to file in json format.
.IP "-m email1,email2,email3"
Email (or list of emails) address to send log at the end of script.

.SH NOTES
Before the main process spawns a new copy to handle a specific station the system gets 
tested for available resources. If not enough resources are found the system limits the 
value of maximum allowed processes to run to -1 the actual value of running processes. 
First the function will test the memory in the system. The memory in use should be 90%
or less the total REAL memory of the system.  Then each CPU in the system gets tested 
until one is found with at least 25% idle time. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  

.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
Only anonymous ftp/http connections.
