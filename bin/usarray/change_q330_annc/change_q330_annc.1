.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Background
The Earthscope USArray Transportable Array (TA) network uses POC initiated operations
to connect to the deployed q330 dataloggers.  This requires the field crews to deploy
the q330s with the ANNC structure properly setup to send these Point-of-Contact (POC)
messages and to send them to host IPs that are ready to acquire them with a running 
\fBpocd(1) \fP processes.  On occassion, the datalogger setup, or modifications 
using Willard go awry and the ANNC structure is set improperly, or the toggle to 
send out the POCs is not checked.  This script is a way for a data center to 
query and/or modify that ANNC structure and is a wrapper around the \fBq330util(1)\fP
command to request or set that structure.  It is a sharp tool, and serious care/caution 
should be taken before you use this on all of your remote dataloggers!!  \fB Please run this 
in test/non-commanding mode with the \fI-n\fP option before unleashing it on your 
remote dataloggers!!\fP  

.SS Auxilliary tables
This script has been developed for use at the ANF where we have implemented various
table extensions to the css3.0 schema to help with the tracking of operational details.
In particular, the default, non \fI -i \fP run of the script requires that a \fIstaq330\fP
table exist.  If you do not have a \fIstaq330\fP table, you will need to run the script 
in interactive mode - a slow process if you have a multitude of dataloggers to check/modify.
The staq330 table is created by the \fBq330_baler(1)\fP script.  If you run in interactive 
mode, you can bypass the need for both a \fIstaq330\fP or \fIq330comm\fP table.



.SH OPTIONS
.LP  
See the EXAMPLE section for examples on how the different options should be selected depending on your task.
You must select either the \fI -i\fP (interactive) mode, or specify a database which
has a staq330 table.
.IP -n 
Run \fBchange_q330_annc\fP in report mode only - NO CHANGES will be made to the datalogger.  
Use this when you want to see what would happen, or get a report on the current settings,  
but not actually affect any datalogger settings.  Highly recommended that you start with this 
option enabled!
.IP -v
Verbose output.
.IP -V
Very verbose output - debugging only.
.IP "-a authcode" 
Password/authentication code for the q330 datalogger.  Default of 0000000000000000 is tried, 
but alternates can be specified with this option or in the parameter file.
.IP -f
This is a "force" option that will report any pre-existing oddities
in setup but will go ahead and change them to your new ones.  This could have potentially critical/disasterous 
consequences to your remote datalogger.  Use with extreme caution! 
.IP "-l logdir"
Directory to store reports of before and after POC settings and annc commands.  Default is \fIchange_q330_annc_logs\fP. 
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Alternate parameter file to use.  The default parameter file name is \fBchange_q330_annc.pf\fP
.IP "-P port"
Use this port number for communications with the q330 rather than the default port number of 5330.
.IP "-x dl_reject_expression"
Expression used to reject dataloggers for change or review.  The code performs dlsta !~/$opt_x/".
.IP "-s dl_select_expression"
Expression used to select dataloggers for change or review.  The code performs dlsta =~/$opt_s/".
.IP "-t targetname_expression"
Expression used to select particular q330 targetnames for change or review.  
.IP "-d dlevent_db"
Database name that contains a dlevent table to record when the settings change took place.  The dlevent
table is a css3.0 extension table used at the ANF.  When a setannc command is to be sent to the dataloggers
a umsg is sent to the datalogger as a record informing when the setting change took place.
.IP "-i" 
Run the script in interactive mode.  This allows single datalogger interaction and is the only
way the script will run if a staq330 table is unavailable.   You must use the \fI-d dlevent_db\fP
option when running in interactive mode.  Either the \fI-i\fP option or the \fIstaq330_db\fP must be used.
.IP staq330_db
Database that contains the staq330 table.  All active dataloggers found in this table will have the
annc structure analized based on the q330 serial number and IP address found in this table.  Use
the \fI-x\fP or \fI-s\fP and \fI-t\fP options to limit which dataloggers are reviewed. 
.SH FILES
.LP
There are three schema extension tables that can accessed by this script:  staq330, q330comm,
and dlevent.  See the documentation available via \fBdbhelp(1)\fP for the css3.0
schema.  See \fBq330_baler(1)\fP for information on populating the staq330 table. See 
\fBq330coms(1)\fP for how the q330comm table is created.  See \fBlogs2dlevent(1)\fP or
\fBdlreport(1)\fP for how the dlevent table is used. 

.LP 
Four output files are created that contain information about the before/after POC settings (report.txt),
a record of the actual \fBq330util\fP setannc commands that are sent (setannccmds.txt), a more detailed 
record of settings (settings.txt), and a shorter list of problem stations (tobefixed.txt).  These 
files are written to the \fIchange_q330_annc_logs\fP directory or your chosen directory if you use the 
\fI-l logdir\fP option, with a timestamp to show what date/time the change was attempted. 
.LP
Examples of these four files are shown:

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh and environment variable $PFPATH set.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The first portion of the parameter file describes the number of POC receivers, authentication
codes to try, and some global settings.  The core portion of the parameter file is the \fI newannc\fP 
structure with named sections for your POC receivers and their individual POC settings.
.IP number_of_active_entries 
This number indicates how many hosts should be sent POCs from the datalogger.  This number must
match the number of setups defined in the newannc section of the parameter file.
.IP default_authcode 
If your network uses a single authorization code for q330 access, specify it here.
.IP alt_auth_codes
If your network uses a variety of possible authorization codes, add them all here.  The
script will cycle through each one if it cannot access the datalogger with the \fI default_authcode\fP.
.IP port_base   
The base port number for q330 communications.  The default value is 5330 and is not normally changed 
unless particular/odd communication paths are needed.  Override of the default can also be done with 
the \fI-p port\fP option which will take precedence.
.IP unlock_flags
This should likely always be set to 0xa00 if you are operating in POC mode.  This sets the serial
number unlocks.
.IP flags
This should likely always be set to 0xa1 as that is the value that indicates that POCs should be sent.
Oft times when a datalogger is not sending POCs after a field visit, setting the annc structure to include
this flag will start the POCs flowing.
.IP dp_udp_port
This should be set to 2254. 
.IP router_ip_addr
This should likely be set to 192.168.33.1.  Do not change it unless you know why it needs to be changed.
.IP newannc
This is an associative array containing named arrays which hold the settings for each of the POC receivers.  The
number of named arrays should match the \fInumber_of_active_entries\fP specified earlier in the 
parameter file.  The names used here do not have to match the nslookup names of the hosts that are
receiving the POCs, but should each be unique.  
.IP "newannc POC settings elements"
Each newannc structure has an associative array that must contain:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

dp_ip_addr	- IP to send POCs to (where a q330pocd process is run)
router_ip_addr	- router IP address.  Almost always set to 192.168.33.1 for TA operations
timeout_in_minutes	- set to 0 so the q330 will continue to send POCs "forever"
resume_time_in_minutes	- delay in minutes without a registered connection before POCs are sent
flags	-  should be set to 0xa1 to indicate POCs should be flowing
dp_udp_port	- should likely always be set to 2254

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP "Could not reach XX_ABCD after attempting all alternate authorization code(s)"
Station was either off-line/no comms, or you are using the wrong authorization code 
when attempting to register.
.IP "No changes to POC setup needed for: XX_ABCD"
Station has POCs setup as specified in your parameter file. 
.IP "Incorrect POC ip (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) in use for XX_ABCD (n) annc structure"
The numbered POC structure \fI(n)\fP has incorrect POC settings.  This datalogger 
will receive a setannc q330util command to modify the POC structures.  Note that 
only the numbered structures will be modified.

Assumes same authorization code across all ports.  
.LP
I expect log messages might be confusing if you have a single datalogger recording 
two stations worth of data (i.e. both XX_ABCD and XX_EFGH are collected via a single
datalogger).  Untested, so use caution.
.LP 
Occassionally, the "Final" report of the annc structure is incomplete in the report.txt output file.
