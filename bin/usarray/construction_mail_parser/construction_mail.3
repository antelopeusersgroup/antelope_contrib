.TH CONSTRUCTION_MAIL 3 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
construction_mail \- mail_parser handler for TA construction reports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
construction_mail_handler( $message, $pfarray );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The construction_mail handler is intended to be launched by the mail_parser(1) 
utility. The TA field personnel routinely sends construction reports
email notifications to anf@ucsd.edu at the end of each new installation. The 
process starts with procmail triggering mail_parser script due to some specified
rule inside .procmailrc file. This rule is set to trigger the script for every 
email with "Construction Report" phrase in the subject line of the email. The rule 
looks like:
.nf

	:0
	* ^Subject:.*Construction Report.*
	{
			:0c
			|/home/reyes/bin/mail_parser_wrapper

			:0:
			$HOME/mail/TEST
	}

.fi
this will run the mail_parser_wrapper and move the original email to an archive
folder named TEST. The mail_parser_wrapper shell script is in charge og setting the
Antelope variables and executing the mail_parser script. It looks like this:
.nf

#!/bin/csh -f

	cd ~
	set ANTELOPE=/opt/antelope/4.10p
	source $ANTELOPE/setup.csh
	setenv PFPATH $ANTELOPE/data/pf:$HOME/data/pf:./pf:.
	exec $ANTELOPE/bin/mail_parser -m -v 

.fi
The handler will check the mail_parser.pf file to create rules out of each
Handler definition in the file. The user will need to add this new Handler to 
the existing mail_parser.pf file. In this case the parser will source 
construction_mail.pl if sender and subject are matched to the incoming message.

In this case the body of the e-mail will be examine for the following values:
.nf

	Date: 
	Station Code: 
	Elevation: 
	GPS: 

.fi
The text after each ":" or "=" will be grab as the value of the variable. This 
variables will match fields on the site table. The script will check for 
validity of the variables first. Then the script will check if there is a 
previous entry for that station name on the table. Then it will do an update
or a new entry to the table.
