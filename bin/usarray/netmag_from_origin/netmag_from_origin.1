.TH NETMAG_FROM_ORIGIN 1

.SH NAME
netmag_from_origin \- generate netmag rows given input origin table with mb, ms, ml fields

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBnetmag_from_origin \fP[-v] [-V] [-s \fIsubset\fP] \fIdb\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnetmag_from_origin\fP was designed to generate netmag tables for old bulletins
that perhaps only collected magnitude information into the mb, ms, and ml
fields of the origin table.  As bulletin collection developed, these magnitude
fields in the origin table were no longer used and separate netmag rows were
always generated.  This script helps bring some of the older bulletins into a
more modern era by generating netmag rows.  Note that initial assumptions that
went into populating those magnitudes in the origin table (i.e. perhaps mapping
md magnitudes into the ml field) cannot be undone, so information may be lost in
this further translation.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose output.
.IP -V
Very verbose output.
.IP "-s subset"
Subset to be applied to the origin table to limit the processing to be done.  This
could be an \fIauth\fP or \fIorid\fP \fIsubset\fP for instance. Use double quotes around
the expression.

.SH FILES
Requires origin table and writable netmag output table.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh
