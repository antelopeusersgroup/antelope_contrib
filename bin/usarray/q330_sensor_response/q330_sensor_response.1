.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_sensor_response\fP calculates responses from calibrations on sensors connected to Q330 dataloggers.
\fBq330_sensor_response\fP first verifies that the 
\fIdlcalwf, dlsensor, sensormodel, wfdisc\fP tables exist in \fIdb\fP.
An optional \fIsta_regex\fP (station regular expression) can be used to run \fBq330_sensor_response\fP.
\fBq330_sensor_response\fP runs \fBdbcalibrate\fP and \fBdisplayscal\fP.  
The ps plots created by  \fBdisplayscal\fP are converted to pdf files by \fBps2pdf14\fP and are
reported in the \fIdb.calplot\fP table.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  No operations executed. 
.IP -C
only run dbcalibrate, skip displayscal and building calplot table
.IP -P
only run displayscal and build calplot table, skip dbcalibrate
.IP "-d calibration_directory"
Directory where station calibrations pdf files are stored.  Each calibration is stored in \fIcalibration_directory/STA\fP
The default \fIcalibration_directory\fP is \fI/anf/TA/products/calibrations\fP.
.IP "-D vnc_display_number"
vnc_display_number where graphics are displayed on when run in background mode on server machines at the ANF.  
This option kills the \fIvnc_display_number\fP once the run is complete.
.IP "-m mail_to"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space.
.IP "-M mail_to_field_ops"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space. This email list will send calibration plots of problem sensors to email addresses.  
This option will not work if the \fB-C\fP option is specified.
.IP -g
If \fB-M\fP option is specified and \fB-C\fP option is not specified, all calibration plots will be sent to \fB-M\fP 
email addresses.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  

.SH RETURN VALUES
0 if successful, 1 if not.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If \fBq330_sensor_response\fP is run under rtexec without a display, then a vnc server needs to be implemented.  
This has been done at the ANF and example configurations can be provided.  In general, this mode of operation
is not recommended and in normal network operations is not needed.
