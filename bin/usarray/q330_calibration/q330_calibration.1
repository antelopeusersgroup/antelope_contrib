.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_calibration\fP runs calibrations on sensors connected to Q330 dataloggers.
\fBq330_calibration\fP first checks to see if the \fIcmdorb\fP is accessible and verifies that the 
\fIdlcalwf, dlsensor, and staq330\fP tables exist in \fIdb\fP.
One or more \fIsta_regex\fP (station regular expressions) are required to run \fBq330_calibration\fP
unless the -i or the -N option is specified.
\fBq330_calibration\fP sends calibrations to q330s by using \fBdlcmd\fP.  The specific parameters 
for the calibration are found in \fIq330_calibration.pf\fP.  Only one type of calibration is allowed
for each sensor listed in the \fIq330_calibration.pf\fP. 

In the \fBq330_calibration\fP default operation, a calibration sweep of all stations defined by 
command line argument station regular expressions is conducted first using channel 3 as the monitor
channel, followed by a sweep using channel 2 as the monitor channel.  This guarantees that all
channels are calibrated while simultaneously recording the original calibration signal.  Each station 
calibration is offset by 0.5 of the duration of the calibration to minimize the number of stations
in calibration mode at one time. 

\fBq330_calibration\fP runs are reported in the \fIdb.dlcalwf\fP table.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode. No operations executed. 
.IP -2
Restrict calibration of stations to using channel 2 as the monitor channel.
.IP -3
Restrict calibration of stations to using channel 3 as the monitor channel.
.IP -i
Calibrate dataloggers and sensors on stations (limited by \fIsta_regex\fP) in the staq330 and dlsensor
tables that have not been calibrated 
using white noise. \fBq330_calibration\fP will check to make sure that both channel 2 and channel
3 have been used as monitor channels.  Missing channels will be calibrated.
The default offset in this case is 0.25.
.IP -N
Calibrate stations (limited by \fIsta_regex\fP) in the staq330 table.  To allow network operations
to continue, only 10% of the stations are calibrated simultaneously, leaving 90% operational. 
The default offset in this case is 0.
.IP "-d no_calib_days"
This option is only valid when used with the \fI-N\fP full network calibration. 
Instead of calibrating the whole network, the \fI-d\fP option will only calibration stations which
have not been calibrated in the last \fIno_calib_days\fP.  This option is useful if a network calibration
is interupted for some reason and you want to complete the missing stations at a later time.  
It is recommended that the \fI-n\fP noop option is used to test what stations need to be calibrated
before actual execution.
.IP "-o duration_offset_fraction"
Offset in time between calibration commands measured as a multiplier of the duration.
The default duration_offset_fraction is \fB0.5\fP.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBq330_calibration\fP.
.IP "-t start_time"
Only calibrate stations which have been deployed after \fIstart_time\fP
.IP "-m mail_to"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space.
.IP "-x 'sta1|sta2|...'"
Station list to exclude from sending a calibration. The listing will be put into an expression
that looks like \fIsta !~ /$opt_x/\fP.  

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.  
.SH PARAMETER FILE
\fBq330_calibration\fP parameter file element is:

.IP sensors 
array of sensor specific parameters for cailbration.  Allowed calibration parameters are found in the
\fBCommands\fP section of q3302orb(1).

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program is fundamentally dependent on the staq330 table which is written to by the program \fBq330_baler\fP.
If you find strange behaviour in the operation of \fBq330_calibration\fP, be sure to check that the \fIstaq330\fP 
table is correct and up to date.  You may need to rerun \fBq330_baler\fP to get things to work as expected.
