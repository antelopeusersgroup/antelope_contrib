Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}
	;

Attribute timetype
	String (1)
	Format ( "%-1s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Range ( "timetype =~ /a|r/" )
	Description ( "Flag or absolute or relative time" )
	Detail {
		Processed waveforms treat time in the time series by
		one of two different standards. They assume either 
		times are all relative to some algorithm specific
		time reference, or the time is based on an absolute
		time standard (norm for raw data in seismology).  
		When this attribute is "a" it the time is assumed
		absolute while "r" denotes a relative time scale.
		In the later case it is up to the application to 
		maintain the time reference.

        Defines pwfid
	Description ( "Core processed waveform table" )
	Detail {
		The antelope trace library is designed to work exclusively
		on data stored in memory.  Not all algorithms one can
		devise for seismic data can work in this mode even on the
		largest computers so a table is needed to store processed
		waveforms in an external database.  The intent of this
		design is that this table is the core table storing all
		intermediate trace data.  Any algorithm will almost 
		certainly create auxiliary tables that can be cross linked
		into this core table through the pwfid field.  In addition
		it would be normal to select as input only traces that 
		are the output of the algorithm field.  MpT
