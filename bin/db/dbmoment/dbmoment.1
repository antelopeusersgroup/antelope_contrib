The Moment Tensor calculation tool included in this distribution is
the core component of the more complex Time-Domain Moment Tensor
INVerse Code (TDMT_INVC) toolbox by Douglas Dreger of the Berkeley
Seismological Laboratory that is in use by miltiple other networks.
The basics on the methods implemented here are described in Jost and
Herrmann(1989).

The calibration of the tool by the implementation of an appropriate 1-D
velocity model is essential to the successful calculation of a moment
tensor. There are several assumptions described in Dreger's documentation
that limit the types of events that we can analyze to be:
    1) Regional events
    2) No big magnitudes. Mw<7.5

We completed the mapping of the source code and some examples from the
original repo distributed by Dreger. This first version will do all the
data processing in Antelope and removed all SAC dependencies.

.SH USER REQUIREMENTS
The code requires a good 2-D model of the region of interest. Some examples
are provided on the distribution. The full explanation of the values needed
for the model are described on the original PDF distributed by Dreger.
The folder MODELS will be installed in the $ANTELOPE/contrib/ directory.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Moment tensors code extracted from mtpackagev1.1 package developed by
Douglas Dreger of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. Green’s
functions computed using the FKRPROG software developed by Chandan Saikia
of URS.


.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdbmoment\fP application calculates the moment tensor for a given
event id (\fIevid\fP) for stations with arrivals associated to that
event.

The time domain seismic moment tensor inversion software package written
by Dreger (2003) and updated by Minson & Dreger (2008) has been repackaged
for inclusion into the open-source contributed code repository for the Boulder
Real Time Technology (BRTT) Antelope Environmental Monitoring System.

The new code-base utilizes the Python interface to Antelope (Lindquist et al., 2008)
for data access and handling. The new code archives all data products into a
Center for Seismic Studies (CSS) 3.0 schema table for easy access and distribution
of solutions. This tool is focused on analyzing local to regional earthquakes. A
calibrated velocity model representative of the south-west continental United States
is included and used for the included examples.

The accompanying Green's functions are either read from the database or generated
dynamically and stored in a database wfdisc. The tool uses a Frequency-Wavenumber
integration program included in Dreger's original distribution.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
Some important values from the parameter file:

.IP \fIantelope\fP
Global variable to make full path later in the PF file.

.IP \fImodel_file\fP
Model for the production of synthetic traces. Just the name. Look
for the file in the "model_path" list. Overwrite with -m flag if needed.

.IP \fImodel_path\fP
All directories to search for the velocity models. Stop on first match.

.IP \fItmp_folder\fP
All temporary files will be written to this folder. Default "./dbmoment/".

.IP \fIimage_folder\fP
All results will produce an image that will be archived in this folder.

.IP \fIclean_tmp\fP
If True then we clean the temporary folder before exiting the code. False will
keep all temporary files on the folder. Good for troubleshooting problems with
the tool.

.IP \fIchan_to_use\fP
Channels which are used in the inversion.

.IP \fIdepth_min/depth_max\fP
Only work with event depths within this range. Verify with values in MODEL!

.IP \fIsta_max\fP
Only calculate the inversion for no more than this amount.

.IP \fIsta_min\fP
Avoid running the inversion if we don't get at least this amount of stations.

.IP \fIfind_executables\fP
Look for these names on the PATH and keep the full path to them in memory. Replace
the path on some scripts that we create on the tmp_folder.

.IP \fIrecursive_analysis\fP
After the first inversion try to remove traces with bad correlations. If we have
unused stations then add the new sites and re-run inversion.

.IP \fImin_variance\fP
Avoid stations with variance reduction lower than this.

.IP \fImin_quality\fP
Each inversion will return a QUALITY value from 0 to 4. Set this as a filter to
avoid injecting bad quality inversions to the database.

.IP \fIfilter_individual_mw\fP
Each station is inverted individually and a max correlation and individual
magnitud is produced. At this point we can avoid adding stations that are
not matching the expected magnitud already present in the database.

.SH EXAMPLE

Dreger’s original code contains an example dataset for us to test the code. The
EXAMPLE_1 from the original distribution was migrated to an Antelope database
consisting of a wfdisc table, an origin and event table and associated dbmaster
tables needed. We started by mapping the original files "testdata[1,2,3]"  to
rows on a wfdisc table. The records on the original database are already rotated
to ZRT, calibrated, filtered and instrument response corrected.

We also added a dbbuild batch file to put some generic metadata for stations.
We decided for stations names [STA1, STA2, STA3]. The only reference to a
location in the example is giving by the azimuth and distance
form the event to each station. WE assigned a random location to the EVID=1 and
then calculated theoretical location to each station from that information.
This created an even with 3 stations located at 100 km each and azimuths of [10,40,50].

To run the experiment you need to compile the code. Run this on the code folder:

    make clean && make && make install

Then you can run both examples by simply using the command:

     \fBrun_dbmoment_example\fP

If you want to run each individual example by hand then you can:

    % cd $(ANTELOPE)/contrib/example/dbmoment/
    % \fBrm\fP -rf synthetics_db
    % \fBrm\fP -rf .dbmoment
    % \fB dbmoment\fP -v EXAMPLE_1/example_1 1
    % \fB dbmoment\fP -v EXAMPLE_2/example_2 1

All temporary working files will go into the ./.dbmoment/ directory, the images with
results will go into ./dbmoment_images/ and synthetics will be saved in ./synthetics_db/
folder.


.SH VELOCITY MODELS
We are collecting all velocity models into a dedicated folder inside the repo
and copying this folder to the contributed folder structure in the main code
distribution folder. The models have a ParameterFile structure and are named in the same
way any other parameter file is but are not included in the general
repository for PF files in Antelope. The implications are that your dbmoment.pf
file will need a full path to the velocity model file because it will not be in
the PFPATH environmental configuration.
The best option will be for you create your own velocity models and
to keep them in a local folder and list this on the dbmoment.pf configuration.
We also appreciate greatly if you can upload your local velocity model to the
contributed code repository and make them available to anyone analyzing
events in similar locations.

.SH CODE STEPS
 First step of the calculation is for the code to open the event database and
 extract all event information from the tables and identify the stations needed.
 This will look into any other reported magnitude and associated arrivals to the event.

 Then the code will extract the traces for each of the stations and will fetch
 synthetics for each of the stations. If the synthetics are not present
 in our database then the tool will create the traces dynamically. Then all
 stations are evaluated to see if they fit the requirements for distance. All
 valid stations will get a first round of individual inversions for this event.

 Then we subset for the stations with correlations above our limit and we order
 them starting with the best correlation. We select the first group for inversion
 to the max number set in the parameter file. After that first inversion the code
 will exit or continue to a secondary review if the recursive flag is set to True
 in the parameter file.

 If we are running recursively then we select the worst performer of the group and
 we evaluate the correlation. If we find the correlation under our threshold then
 we remove the site and we try to add a new station. We send the new group to the
 next inversion and we evaluate the results one more time.

 This recursive method continues until:
    1) All sites correlation are above our threshold limit
    2) We run out of stations.

 Running on (-v) or (-d) mode will produce a plot at the end script that will
 compare the original traces with the theoretical calculations for each station
 based on our synthetics and the values of the tensor returned by the tool.

 At the end of every run the system will update the “mt” table and the “netmag”
 tables with the results. If a previous entry for the same ID and AUTH is found on the
 tables then we remove the old entry before adding a new row with the new results.

.SH SYNTHETIC TRACES
Synthetics are archived on a wfdisc table using a schema based on depth and distance to the
event. We use a model of lazy evaluation which delays the creation of a synthetic trace
until its value is needed.

The value for the station name is our DEPTH to the event. The value for the channel
is our event to station DISTANCE and the seismic element is specified in the
LOC code of the channel name.
i.e.
    depth: 8
    distance: 10
    element: TDS
    => 8_10_TDS ( format: sta_chan_loc )

The format allows us to clearly see all traces related to the same depth on the
dbpick window organized by distance. It inverts the originally proposed schema
but the benefits justify the changes. If you ran versions of the code earlier
than 1/2016 then you might need to remove the synthetic databases and allow the
software to produce new versions of it.
