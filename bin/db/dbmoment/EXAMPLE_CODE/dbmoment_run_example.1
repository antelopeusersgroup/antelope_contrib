.TH DBMOMENT_RUN_EXAMPLE 1

.SH NAME
dbmoment_run_example \- run dbmoment on 2 example events

.SH SYNOPSIS
    dbmoment_run_example [temp_dir]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dreger's inversion source code is included in the contributed code
repo as well as 2 full examples from the original distribution.
The data needed for the example is located on folders "EXAMPLE_1" and
"EXAMPLE_2".

Inversion will have the same limitations as the original Dreger's
code and users should be familiar with Dreger's documentation.


.SH ENVIRONMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then
compile the source code.

    make clean;
    make;
    make install;

It will require write access to the example folder:

    $ANTELOPE/contrib/example/dbmoment/

OR...  you can run with a possible argument for a
work folder that the process will use to create
some tables that will link to the ones in the
main distribution. You need to do this if you
don't have write access to $ANTELOPE folder.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLE
You can run the dbmoment code by hand from any directory.

Run directly in terminal:

    dbmoment_run_example

This will go to the example folder "$ANTELOPE/contrib/example/dbmoment/" and
will run both examples. You will see several new folders.

    .dbmoment       => Temp folder for calculations.
    synthetics_db   => Includes all databases for synthetics.
    dbmoment_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.
    mt db tables    => Results will go into a new 'mt' table.
