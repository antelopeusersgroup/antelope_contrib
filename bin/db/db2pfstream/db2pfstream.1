.SH NAME
db2pfstream - build database view and send metadata as a pfstream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
db2pfstream  db file [-n -V -v -pf pffile -sift expression]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
db2pfstream is a generalized input function for a processing system
based on a concept of a pfstream.  A pfstream is a way to 
encapsulate
pieces of metadata data that could be attached to an arbitrary 
data object to define it.  This program is designed to build a 
(potentially long) stream of these pf blocks and feed the results
into an output file.  It is expected that file would normally be
a fifo to allow the output of this program to feed directly into
a secondary processing algorithm without actually taking up 
space for the pf data.  This is intended as a simple data model
for parallel processing algorithms that are data driven like
most seismic applications.  
.LP
The \fBdb\fR and \fBfile\fR parameters are required.  
db is assumed to be an antelope database and file is the output
file name (can and would normally be a fifo created with 
mkfifo).  The default assumes a parameter file exists 
in PFPATH called db2pfstream.pf that controls most of what
this program will do (see below).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -n
Run with no output.  Normal procedure should be to run this program
with this flag set to verify all the database attributes that are
required downstream are present in the database. 
.IP -V
Print usage line and exit immediately doing nothing. 
.IP -v
Be verbose in output.  This is most useful if the -n flag is set
but it will create a lot of messages that may not matter.  The 
primary difference is that when -v is set passthrough parameters
(see parameter file description below) are checked for null values 
and all nulls are listed. 
.IP -pf
Read from alternative parameter file pf instead of default.
.IP -sift
Apply a final subset condition \fIexpression\fR to the working
database view before starting.  This is most useful if a processing
stream is being driven by a scripting language to do something 
like event based processing one event at a time or for manually
spitting up flow between banks of processors.  
Otherwise this can generally be done more easily by modification of
the parameter file to set the input view.

.LP
\fIdbprocess_list\fR is a Tbl list that is passed directly to dbprocess
to build the working view for this program.   This is a VERY important
parameter in two ways.  First, it defines the set of joins that will
be needed to build the complete suite of attributes to be passed into
the ouput stream.  Second, it must define the sort order properly to 
provide the right grouping when ensemble output is requested (see below).
.LP
The boolean, \fIensemble_mode\fR, controls the basic output mode.
If this parameter is false, the program writes pf's in single 
object (row) mode.  That is, a block of parameters is written to 
the output stream for each row in the input database view.  
If \fIensemble_mode\fR is set true, the the output will be 
blocks of paremeters with repeating names surrounded by the 
parameter file block 
.nf
ensemble &Arr{
   ... 
}  
.fi
(see example above)
When \fIensemble_mode\fR is true this program searchs for 
two lists called 
\fIensemble_keys\fR and \fIgrouping_keys\fR. 
The \fIensemble_keys\fR parameter defines the grouping 
that defines one data object that is to be processed by
a downstream algorithm.  That is, an ensemble is the basic
unit of granularity of the algorithm that is to use these
data.  (Note the ensemble is assumed to have only one 
element/database row if ensemble_mode is false. )  That is,
it defines the outer blocking of the pfstream. 
The \fIgrouping_keys\fR is optional for an ensemble and 
defines a secondary grouping of the ensemble.   
A typical example of this might be an ensemble of 
three-component seismograms with the gather defining
the ensemble and the grouping defining the collections of
three-components for each station.  
It is VERY important that the \fIprocess_list, ensemble_keys,\fR and
\fIgrouping_keys\fR be internally consistent and sensible for the input
database.  The process_list must make sure the sort order is consistent
with the grouping and the ensemble and group keys need to be consistent
or chaos can result.  The basic advice to keep in mind is this.
First, the process_list should sort the data in the order of the 
combined ensemble and group keys with the ensemble sort first.  
Second, make SURE that if group keys are used the group_key list
should contain the ensemble keys as the first entries in the list.  
This is necessary because the program simply calls dbgroup twice:
once with the ensemble key and (when requested) a second time with
the group keys.  The group keys are assumed to be a finer grouping
than the ensemble keys.
.LP
\fIvirtual_table_name\fR is the tag assigned to the outer block
defining an ensemble.  That is, multiple ensembles with 
different tags can be embedded in a single pfstream block.
This allows a fairly general way to map from one name space
to another or one database schema to another.  For the example
described in the FILES section above this tag was set to example.
.LP
\fIsleep_time\fR sets the time the program will sleep before 
closing it's output file.  This should be set to the maximum
expected execution time for downstream processing of one 
data object.  It can be set to zero if the output is an
ordinary file.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The sleep_time parameter is unquestionably a kludge.  It is a less
than elegant way to work around a problem with a fifo when downstream
processes operate in feeding mode (i.e. open, read one block, close)
from a fifo.  It is necessary because if db2pfstream closes and the
other end does not have the fifo open for read the last block of
data will be dropped.  This could probably be done better by using
bidirectional communication capabilities of named pipes described
in streamio(7).
.LP
The interaction of the process_list, ensemble_key, and group_key
parameters is complex and perhaps should be forced.  Here it is 
up to the user to make sure they understand the database well enough
and the grouping process to guarantee it all works right.  In general
this should not be awful because stock pf files should be build for
any application to be the receiver of a pfstream.
