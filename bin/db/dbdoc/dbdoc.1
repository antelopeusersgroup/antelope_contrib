.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDbdoc\fR combines a set of introductory files with the
the information from the schema files to create a (troff)
formatted document describing a \fIdatabase\fP.
.LP
Basically, \fBdbdoc\fP creates three sections :
.IP 1)
a set of figures which describe each relation (table) including
each attribute (field) and its character
position, format and brief description.
.IP 2)
A set of descriptions of each relation (table) in the \fIdatabase\fP,
including the primary, alternate, and foreign keys, and a description
of the table's purpose.
.IP 3)
A set of descriptions of all the attributes used in the tables,
including the tables in which they appear, their format, legal
values, null values and description.
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
.IP tables
This is a list of the tables from the schema to
include in the output.
.IP intro
.IP relation_tables_intro
.IP relation_desc_intro
.IP attribute_desc_intro
These parameters should describe files which are
included in the output at the beginning (intro), and
before the corresponding section.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The \fIintroductory\fP files are the glue between pages of the
printed documentation.
However, usually you will need to edit them for your own work
-- most macros
must be left in, but most of the verbiage removed or changed.
