/*  dbmwspec

Usage: dbmwspec dbin [-V -pf pffile -s spec_dir  -jack -correct]

This routine uses the multiwindow spectral estimation method (also 
called multitaper method) using a fortran subroutine obtained from
Frank Vernon. This is a second generation program that is a descendent
of an earlier one called "dbspectra".  It differs from the former
largely in the fact that the algorithm used to handle the data is 
far simpler than the earlier program.  That is, here all we do is
join the wfdisc and arrival tables  (Note these are css3.0 schema
specific so this program depends upon css3.0) and process this 
join table.  The program process keys on phase picks so the basic
algorithm is for each line in the recipe file we subset the 
joined wfdisc-arrival table for the key phase and then just loop 
through the subsetted table.  

written:  July 1995

Modified June 2001

Replaced recipe file by a normal parameter file.  Now use a pf tbl
with the same items noted above, but keyed by the parameter name
spectra_windows

Argument list changed also to reflect this.  

Modified Feb 2003
Fairly major changes to change database output form.  Original code
used a "psdisc" table that was special to this program.  That table
had some problems.  BRTT produced a "specdisc" table for another 
project.  To reduce confusion I adapted this program to that structure.
They are extremely similar, but some fairly major modification followed.
The biggest problem is that spectral ratio programs that used to feed
off this table are completely broken because I removed the "sname" 
parameter that was an important key in that processing scheme.  
I did that on purpose because it was a bad scheme.  
This form is better to release to the world.
Modified April 2004
1. Replaced scv2 trace manipulation by tr routine.  This allows reading
miniseed.
2. Implemented -correct option.  Was only stubbed before.

/* Special function to fix problem with overlapping segments in spectral 
calculations using triggered data.  Sometimes retriggering led to overlapping
wfdisc segments.  We handle this here in a way that is not as robust as
it probably should be, but should work over 99% of the time.  The only way
it would fail is if the time window desired was fairly long and extended
outside the boundaries of the overlap.   In that situation the traces 
could, in principle, be glued back together, but in fact that kind of problem
should be fixed at demux time anyway.  

Arguments:  db - db view that must have been formed as a join of the 
		wfdisc and arrival tables and sorted by sta,time,arrival.time, 
		and wfdisc start time.  Results are unpredictable if this is
		pointed at any other arbitrary view.
	    sps - This stucture specifies the time window around the 
		arrival.time field.  It is used to be sure we keep the 
		most appropriate row of the table 

Function is void because the use of dbmark dbcrunch doesn't
create a new view so the db is altered in place.
