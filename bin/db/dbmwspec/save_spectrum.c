/*
This function writes a spectral result stored in array spec to an output file 
defined with name formed as dir/dfile.  spec is assumed to hold nfreq 
floats.  

Normal return is foff returned by ftell (0 or position appended from)
Any negative return indicates an error:

	-1 - cannot open file
	-2 - write error


Author:  Gary Pavlis
Written:  August 1994
Modified:  July 1995 for revised spectral program now called mwspec.  
Changed behaviour such that when a file doesn't exist it is created.
and the function returns 0.  If the file name exists, the function seeks
to the end of the file and appends the given data onto the end of the 
given file.  In this condition it returns foff (end of previous file)
This was done to reduce the number of files generated by this program.

/*
This function writes spectral estimates to output files and updates a
database table defining each spectral estimate.  The logical variable "jack"
controls what exactly is written.  If jack is 0, only the contents of the
array "s" are saved.  If jack is nonzero, upper and lower 95% 
confidence limits are also calculated. 
Args:
tr - db pointer to trace object from which this spectrum was derived
db - input database pointer
p - descriptor of this spectral window derived from recipe file 
s - float vector of length nfft/2+1 of spectral estimate
error-parallel array to s containing jackknife error estimates
nfft - size parameter for s
nsamples - length of original time series
dt - original times series sample interval
pick - base window epoch time (normally a measured arrival time )
dir - directory to write output files to
jack - logical switch (see above)\

Returns:
	0  - normal aok
	-1 - could not write spectral output files
	-2 - dvaddv failure in writing spectral file
	-3 - like -1 but for confidence limits file
	-4 - like -2 but for confidence limit db entry.
	-5 - error from dbgetv extracting parameters from database
