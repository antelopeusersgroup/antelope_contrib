.SH NAME
dbfix_phase \- fix phasecode in assoc table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbfix_phase \fP[-v] [-dry] [-pf \fIpfname\fP] [-sitedb \fIsitedb\fP]
                [-use_assoc_vmodel] [-use_iphase] [-override_phase]
                \fIdb\fP [\fIorid\fP]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is intended to 'beautify' the assoc table by assigning informative phase codes. This can be useful if one wants to produce a nice bulletin.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
verbose flag. Repeat to increase verbosity.
.IP "-dry"

dry run, display only what the program would normally do.
.IP "-pf pfname"

Parameter file name.
.IP "-sitedb sitedb"

Use site information from this database instead of the input database. Mainly for debugging purposes.
.IP "-use_assoc_vmodel"

Compute theoretical traveltimes using the velocity model specified in the assoc table. The default is to use the model specified in the parameter file with the parameter default_vmodel
.IP "-use_iphase"

Set assoc.phase to arrival.iphase and look for nicer phasenames \fBonly\fP if arrival.iphase is one of the \fIsuspicious_phase_codes\fP specified in the parameter file.
.IP "-override_phase"

Modify all pahase in assoc.phase, not only those specified in the parameter file as \fIsuspicious_phase_codes\fP.
.IP "db"

database.
.IP "orid"
The origin id that identifies the origin to process. If this argument is not specified, all origins are processed.

.IP "apply_station_corrections"
set to yes if you want station corrections. But station corrections require more work on other (undocumented) places. I only put this in because it is possible, not because I think it is of any use.
.IP "method"
see(tt)
.IP "default_vmodel"
velocit model used. Note that this will be overriden with the commandline argument -use_assoc_vmodel.
.IP "tt_phase_code"
Specifies which phases are considered. See tt(3).
.IP "max_tdelta"
Leave phase unchanged if residual would exceed this limit. A value of -1 accepts everything.
.IP "suspicious_phase_codes"
List of phases that will be changed by the program. Typically a location program sets assoc.phase to some reasonable phasecode or simply P or S. In the latter case, this program can polish up your bulletins.
.IP "dont_change_to"
List of weak phases which are hardly visible. Use this to ignore exotic phases you don't pick on a regular basis.
.IP "simplify"

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP "table assoc must be present!"
This indicates that the input database is incomplete.
.IP "table assoc must be writable!"
Permissions don't allow modification of the input database.
.IP "sta XYZ not found in sitetable"
Your input database is incomplete. Consider specifying a more complete database using the -\fIsitedb\fP parameter.
.IP "problem computing travel-times using vmodel mymodel->aborting"
Something really went wrong. I believe this should not happen unless one experiments with -use_assoc_vmodel.
