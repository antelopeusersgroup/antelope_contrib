.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbpick_combine\fP is intended to make waveform review of data from two 
distinct database easier by combining a subset of each input database and
viewing it in dbpick.  This assumes that the two input databases are related
in some fashion and have data from overlapping time windows.  For instance, 
\fIdb1\fP may contain your seismic waveform data while \fIdb2\fP may contain
your state of health data (mass positions, system voltage, etc.).  Rather 
than starting two separate instances of \fBdbpick\fP, you can create a view 
that shows all traces in the same dbpick window.  
.LP
\fBdbpick_combine\fP subsets the arrival, site, and wfdisc tables 
from the input databases, \fIdb1\fP and \fIdb2\fP and makes them available
in the output database used for \fBdbpick\fP.  You must have a site 
table available for \fIdb1\fP if you are using the -nearby option.  
No attempts are made to clean up duplicate picks or \fIdel\fP picks from 
the input database. The arrival table is not necessary.  
.LP
Optionally, one can choose to save this combined waveform database 
for later use by using the \fI-k\fP and \fI-q\fP options.  The \fI-q\fP option negates the startup
of \fBdbpick\fP and leaves it to the user to review at a later time.  This
could be useful if you need to manipulate the combined database.  For instance
if you need to apply calibs and segtypes to the combined database.  Any post
database creation steps are left to the user to devise.
.LP
A \fBdbpick\fP waveform window is generated with the \fBdbpick\fP prompt appearing 
in the same window where you ran the \fBdbpick_combine\fP
command.  Make sure you type \fIquit\fP at the dbpick prompt rather than 
using Cntrl-C or the window manager close button on the waveform display 
window.  Not following this step may result in a failure of cleanup for
the temporary databases.

.SH OPTIONS
Either the \fI-sta\fP or \fI-nearby\fP option must be specified!
.IP "-nearby sta"
Subset the database so that only stations close to \fIsta\fP are 
in the output view.  This station must be in the input database
\fIdb1\fP.  The default is to collect all stations within 2 degrees
of sta.  Use \fI-dist\fP to change the default.  Instead of specifying a 
specific station, you can use a coordinate.  This negates the need
for \fIdb1\fP to have a site table.  Format would be:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
  -nearby 33.3:-106.75
.fi
.ft R
.in
.IP "-dist distance"
With \fI-nearby\fP, collect stations that are within distance range of the
station (or coordinates) specified with the \fI-nearby\fP option.  Has 
no affect if you are using the \fI-sta\fP option. 
.IP "-sta station_subset"
Subset the input databases so that only the station_subset stations are 
available. Examples of valid subsets include:  
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

/A04A/
/N0.A|M1.A/
/L.*/

.fi
.ft R
.in
.IP "-chan channel_subset"
A basic channel subset to be applied to the arrival and wfdisc tables of
\fIdb1\fP and \fIdb2\fP.  Examples of valid subsets include:  
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

/BHZ/
/BH[ZNE]|VM./
/L.*/

.fi
.ft R
.in
At the moment, negative subsets are not allowed.
.IP "-start start_time"
Start time of data to be reviewed.  All data after this start_time is
selected from the wfdiscs and arrivals (if available) of \fIdb1\fP 
and \fIdb2\fP.
.IP "-end end_time"
End time of data to be reviewed.  All data before this end_time is  
selected from the wfdiscs and arrivals (if available) of \fIdb1\fP 
and \fIdb2\fP.  This is sometimes necessary for large real-time databases.
See BUGS and CAVEATS below.
.IP "-k"
Keeps all temporary databases, including very transitory ones that are 
created in the same directory where the \fIdb1\fP and \fIdb2\fP databases 
reside.  These databases can clutter up that input database directory, so 
use sparingly and/or remember to go and delete those \fIdbpick_combine$$\fP 
databases.
.IP "-chan channel_subset"
Subset the input databases so that only the \fIchannel_subset\fP channels are 
available. Examples of valid subsets include:  
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
.ne 7

/BH./
/BH.|VM./
/L.*EP|LHZ|LHZ_01/

.fi
.ft R
.in
.IP -q
Do not start \fBdbpick\fP during the running of this script.  This is 
useful when combined with \fI-k\fP as it allows the generated output 
database to be kept for further review and manipulation.  This is only
useful if you combine it with the \fI-k\fP option.  If you do not keep
the database tables and do not view them when \fBdbpick\fP is run within the 
script, there is no point in even running this script.
.IP -tmpdir
Name of directory to use for keeping temporary database files.  If 
this is not specified, a directory called \fItmpdbpc\fP will be 
created and used.  This directory is removed when this script finishes 
unless the \fI-k\fP option is used.  Temporary database files are 
created within this directory including one called \fIdbpick_combine_$$\fP.
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -V
Very verbose.  Useful for debugging only.

Temporary database files are also created in the directory of the 
input databases.  They look something like: dbpick_combine19166 
and should be automatically removed upon exit of the program
unless \fI-k\fP is used. See BUGS AND CAVEATS!
.SH ENVIRONMENT
You must be able to run X-windows programs.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
I have seen errors like:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 7

2007-234 16:25:49 dbcp *log*: Bad record id 81 in db pointer
2007-234 16:25:49 dbcp *log*: bad db type in dbputv

.fi
.in
.ft R
when this program is run on large real-time databases.  I have not been
able to reliably reproduce the error yet.  The only work-around I can 
suggest is that you use -end with a time before the most recent time 
in the wfdisc table.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
This was in shop code that I am freeing into the world.  It may not 
do what you want it to do, but it worked for me.  Requests for upgrades 
and changes may be taken into consideration, but action on them may take
a long while.
.LP
No support yet for expanded subsetting capabilities (i.e. sta !~/A0.*/ 
&& sta=~/A1.*/).  I am considering this and may end up re-writing code 
in such a way that may not be backward compatible with the -sta and -nearby
options.  
.LP
Better error message and check is needed if the -sta subset is for a station 
that is not in the site table.
.LP
Can leave detritus database files and descriptors around if program exits 
abnormally.
.LP
Some of the subsets can take a significant amount of time if the database 
tables are large.  Have patience.
.LP
There are some rm commands in this script.  Bad choice of input dbs could 
cause an important database to be removed.  Please do not use any database
names containing \fBdbpick_combine\fP for either of your input databases.  
Save a backup of the input dbs if you are paranoid like me.
.LP
The original version of this script had a \fI-keep\fP option rather than \fI-k\fP.
It never worked.  Use \fI-k\fP instead.
