smartpick \- Graphical driver for dbpick
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsmartpick \fP[\-nowait] [\-appname \fIwindow_name\fP]
                [\-winfile \fIfilename\fP]                 [\-comout

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsmartpick\fP is a graphical-user-interface driver for dbpick. It allows
button-driven control of the most common prompt-based navigation
commands to dbpick, plus several other common commands. A button to
launch dbe on the database being viewed is also included. Smartpick will
complain and die if no wfdisc table is present in the database. If a
trial database name is specified, the trial database is used to look up
association information for displaying picked traces. This is provided
for compatibility with dbloc2. If the trial database is not specified, the
default input database is used for looking up association information.

smartpick expects a very particular and strict interpretation of the
network.nettype field, and the network and affiliation tables, in order
to build the full set of network menus.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -nowait
Bring up dbpick automatically upon startup
.IP -nostarttalk
Synomym for -nowait, done for ease of use with dbloc2
.IP -appname window_name
Argument \fIwindow_name\fP is passed to dbpick as the -appname option
.IP -winfile winfile
Argument is passed to dbpick as the -winfile option. If this option is
not specified, the default name "smartpick_dbpick" is used, or a unique
name is generated if that file already exists.
.IP -comout named_pile
Argument is passed to dbpick as the -comout option.
.SH FILES
.IP smartpick_dbpick
default name of winfile created for dbpick, if one
is not specified on the command line. If one already exists, a unique name
will be generated. This file is removed upon normal exit.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program was originally written for a specific application, 
and has been slowly generalized. Many parts of the internals should 
be rewritten, to remove prototype strategies, clean up the code, and 
replaces hacks with correct engineering. However, the program has been
popular enough and requested widely enough that it is being submitted on
an 'as-is' basis.  

Lingering winfiles from previous runs (e.g. smartpick_dbpick) would
confuse some dbpick options in previous editions. Generation of
unique winfile names hopefully fixed this. If \fBsmartpick\fP exits normally (i.e.
with the Quit button), it will clean up the winfile made by dbpick.
