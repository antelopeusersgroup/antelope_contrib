.TH POLYGON2XY 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
polygon2xy \- export polygon data for usage with \fBGMT\fP.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBpolygon2xy \fP[-n] [-subset \fIexpr\fP] \fIdb\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpolygon2xy\fP writes the vertices of polygons stored in a database to standard out. Polygons are closed by appending the 1st vertex if not already closed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-n"
write polygon name \fBpname\fP to header
.IP "-subset expr"
Datascope expression to subset the database. See dbexpressions(5) and polygon1.2(5).
.IP db
Database object containing the polygon data. Note that the database must at least contain a table polygon. If specified as \fI-\fP, the input is read from stdin. See the examples below.
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

.ne 5

Export the border of Austria:

polygon2xy -subset "pname=~/Austria/" mydb > Austria.xy

dbsubset mydb.polygon "pname=~/Austria/"|\\
        polygon2xy - > Austria.xy

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The output is in the form of a \fImultiple segment file\fP, i.e the individual polygons are preceeded by a \fB>\fP and the -M flag must be specified when running \fIpsxy\fP with the output.
If the selected records are closed (if closed is set to "y" in the database), the output is a closed polygon, i.e there is no need to specify the -L flag to psxy. This allows to plot both polygons, lines and points from the same file.
