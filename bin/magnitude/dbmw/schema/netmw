Attribute netmw
        Real (7)
        Format ( "%7.2f" )
        Null ( "-999.00" )
        Description ( "network moment  magnitude" )
        Detail {
                This is the moment magnitude of an event.  Associated with
                this attribute is the identifier mwid, which points to
                magid in the netmagw relation.  The information in that
                record summarizes the method of analysis and the data
                used.  See imb, iml, ims, magnitude, magtype, mb and ms.
