	Detail {
		metric measured from range of values in signal and noise 
                time windows.

Attribute compratio
	Real (8)
	Format ( "%8.2f" )
	Null ( "-999.0000" )
	Description ( "Component ratio" )
	Detail {
		In three component data it is useful to measure the ratio
                of amplitudes between all pairs of componnts.  This stores
                the largest such ratio in a time window.
