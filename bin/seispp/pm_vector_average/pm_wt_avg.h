  /*! Main constructor.

  This constructor uses construction is initialization.   The input data
  vectors d and e are processed to yield a weighted average estimate of
  an average unit vector (held in private and extractable by a method below).

  \param d - is the data vector of normal vectors.
  \param e - is a parallel vector to d containing angle errors (in radians)
    of each vector in d.   Note the assumption is the angle involved is
    angle of cos theta = x.y formula. The algortithm used to compute
    the error in the mean here assumes these are scaled in a consistent
    way.  We compute a standard weighted mean using sum d_i/e_i/sum 1/e_i
  \param scale is a multiplier used to convert e estimates to 1/sigma
    for a normal distribution.  Internally each e_i is converted to a
    weight w_i=1/(e_i*scale).   This is needed since mwpm uses a bootstrap
    error method with a specified confidence.
  \param pen - sets the penalty function to use for robust averaging.
    Allowed choices are BISQUARE and HUBER.   Use NONE for simple
    average.   Robust averages are m-estimators using a median as
    an initial estimate.  Default is NONE.
  \param mrwtr controls an exit condition for unstable robust weighting.
    When the ratio of the sum of residual weights (weights are always
    near one when the scaled residual is small) to the total number of
    data points falls below this value the constructor will throw a
    SeisppError exception with a diagnostic message.   Default is 0.10
  \param probability is used to defne the scale factor used for
    automatic scaling of the robust estimation procedure.  The scale
    factor is set to the angle defined by the nearest data point at
    the nearest quantile to this point.  i.e the data are sorted by
    angle and the nearest data to this value is used to define the
    robust scale.   Default is 0.8.  A negative value turns off
    automatic scaling and assumes the scale factor is one.   Note
    angles are already internally nondimensional as all are divided
    by sigma.
