# CWPROOT is used by Seismic Unix.  This program uses library
# routines in seismic unix.   Currently this is not integrated into
# with the localmake.config setup in antelope.  glp (9/22/2017)
# This program was produced by copying and editing SU3CEnsembleConverter
# which first did this.   ReadSegyTrace should be identical to that program.
