    <h1>mask_pm_snr</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>mask_pm_snr [-v --help -text -pffile] &lt; in &gt; out<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    This program should be viewed as a preprocessor for <a
      href="./mwpmavg.html">mwpmavg.</a>&nbsp; The input to the program
    is a serialized file of PMTimeSeries objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The output
    is a modified set of the same data that would normally be passed
    directly to <a
href="file:///opt/antelope/5.9/src/contrib/bin/seispp/html/programs/mwpmavg.html">mwpmavg.</a><br>
    <br>
    The first this program does is scan a time window (defined by the pf
    file) that is assumed to represent a section of background (random)
    noise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplitude is defined by the length of the major
    axis of the particle ellipse estimated at each (noise) time
    step.&nbsp;&nbsp; The noise level is set as the median of the
    lengths of that set of vectors.&nbsp; The program then computes a
    minimum amplitude that it should consider signal from the parameter
    <i>snr_floor</i>.&nbsp; The computed signal level is then used to
    establish times of valid signal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections of the signal
    where the level drops below that floor are considered
    noise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note there are complexities that can enter in the
    special case when the preevent noise window is very
    short.&nbsp;&nbsp; That feature was added to support active source
    data where preevent times can be very short.&nbsp; It should never
    be an issue with modern passive recording with continuous
    data.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the pf file section for a description of how
    to handle this special case.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The program defines invalid times (below the floor) as marked time
    gaps in the output.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the reason the program name
    has the keyword mask as the idea is those sections of data are then
    masked from subsequent processing with <a
href="file:///opt/antelope/5.9/src/contrib/bin/seispp/html/programs/mwpmavg.html">mwpmavg.</a>&nbsp;
    There are several features that it was necessary to add to this idea
    to make the results stable:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Normally all data from the beginning (first sample of the
        vector of particle motion ellipses) to the end of the defined
        noise time window are marked as a gap.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        assumption is that all is preevent noise and shouldn't be
        handled.</li>
      <li>To avoid large numbers of very short gap definitions when the
        signal level is close to the floor, the number of samples in the
        gap must be larger than that defined by the parameter <i>minimum_samples_per_gap</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <p><i>-pf</i> <i>pffile<br>
      </i>Use <i>pffile </i>instead of default (always the name of the
      main program)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Standard arguments:&nbsp; DELETE THIS LINE FOR OTHER THAN
      TEMPLATE file<br>
    </p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <i>-text<br>
    </i>Write the output in text format.&nbsp; Default is binary
    serialized file.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-v<br>
    </i>Be more verbose.&nbsp; Note all log information goes to stderr
    so it is best to use this option only for debugging problems.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Parameter file:</h3>
    <i>snr_floor<br>
    </i>This parameter specifies the signal level that is considered
    valid (see above).&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the units of this parameter are
    in decibels defined in the usual way as 20log_10
    (A_signal/A_noise).&nbsp;&nbsp; The signal-to-noise as an amplitude
    ratio is then 10^(snr_floor/20).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>noise_window_start_time </i>and <i>noise_window_end_time<br>
    </i>This pair of parameters define the time period that defines the
    noise window for processing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note this is useful only if
    defined in relative time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally this program can only
    work if the data are in relative time.&nbsp; That usually means the
    output of mwpm has to be passed through the <a href="./ator.html">ator</a>
    filter.<br>
    <i></i><br>
    <i>minimum_noise_samples<br>
    </i>Defines the smallest number of samples that are allowed in a
    valid data gap. (see above for motivation)&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>noise_level_key<br>
    </i>The computed noise level is saved to the Metadata area of the
    output data with this string access key.<br>
    <br>
    <i>absolute_snr_floor, force_absolute_snr_floor, </i><i>scan_for_zeros,
    </i>and<i> floor_to_define_zero<br>
    </i>This set of parameters are relevant only for active source data
    where the preevent time may be short and/or the data are zero padded
    at the front to reduce edge effects.&nbsp;&nbsp; When <i>force_absolute_snr_floor
    </i>is true (default is false) the noise floor calculation is
    ignored and the critical signal level is set to the value defined by
    this parameter in a very different way.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, the
    program finds the largest major axis amplitude in the input and
    computes the floor as that amplitude divided by <i>absolute_snr_floor.
      &nbsp; </i>(Apologies for the inconsistence.&nbsp; This value is
    NOT in dB). &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>scan_for_zeros</i> and <i>floor_to_define_zero</i> are a related
    feature to handle front zero padding.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>floor_to_define_zero
      sets an absolute value to define a hard zero.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>When
    used with<i> </i><i>scan_for_zeros</i> set as true any data in the
    preevent period with amplitude less than <i>floor_to_define_zero </i>are
    set as a data gap in the output.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
