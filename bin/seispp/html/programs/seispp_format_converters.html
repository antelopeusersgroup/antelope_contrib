    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    The boost serialization library used by this package of programs
    supports binary and text output formats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both are opaque
    to a human reader, but a text file is theoretically easy to
    transport between machines and is the default for all
    applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; This pair of filters converts files of
    ThreeComponentEnsemble objects between the two formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    seispp_b2t converts binary to text format and seispp_t2b does the
    opposite.<br>
    <br>
    Note the strong limitation that only serialized
    ThreeComponentEnsemble object are currently supported.&nbsp; <br>
