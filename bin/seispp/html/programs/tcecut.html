    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>tcecut tmin tmax&nbsp; &lt; in &gt; out [-v --help -text]<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    This program can be used to apply a reduced time window to
    seismograms stored in ThreeComponentEnsemble objects serialized to
    the input file read from stdin.&nbsp; It is conceptually equivalent
    to the Seismic Unix program suwind run in time windowing
    mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The time interval to extract is defined by the time range
    tmin&lt;=t&lt;=tmax.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more than a single ensemble
    this always requires the data be in a relative time
    standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two current examples are
    multichannel shot gathers where time 0 is the shot time and the
    arrival time reference used, for example, in dbxcor.&nbsp; It is
    possible to use epoch times for tmin and tmax, but I can think of no
    example where this would be appropriate for more than a single
    ensemble.&nbsp; The only example of this I can conceive is an gather
    formed from a set of stations that span a common absolute time
    window.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <i>-text</i><br>
    Write the output in text format.&nbsp;  Default is a binary serialized file.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>-v <br>
    </i>More verbose output to stderr.<br>
