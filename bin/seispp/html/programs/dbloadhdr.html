    <h1>dbloadhdr</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>dbloadhdr db [-t type -o logfile -pf pffile --help -binary] &lt;
      infile &gt; outfile<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    This is intended as a general purpose program to load attributes
    from an Antelope database into the standard data objects defined in
    the seispp library.&nbsp;&nbsp; It depends on two key concepts in
    the Antelope API:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The program uses <i>dbprocess</i> (see man(3) dbprocess) to
        build a working virtual table commonly called a "view".&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>The object stored in the input file must already have a set of
        attributes that can provide a unique match to the working
        view.&nbsp; Ideally the match should be one-to-one, but if the
        key provides an unambiguous match to a set of many rows that are
        all identical for the required attributes, the algorithm should
        still work.&nbsp; In the later case, however, it can throw a lot
        of error messages.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    The program was designed to blunder on and do something even if it
    is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide quality control the program has the
    option to generate a log file of what attributes were set for each
    object in the file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the log file is optional it
    is almost always wise to create it unless you are repeating a
    process that was known previously to work.&nbsp; The program outputs
    special "bad" outputs in the log file for values not set because of
    a failure to match the keys provided.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad values
    are:<br>
    <table width="40%" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><i>Data type</i><br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top"><i>Bad value</i><br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">integer<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">-999999999<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">real<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">-999999999E-99<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">string<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">UNDEFINED<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">boolean<br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">--not supported--<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    Note booleans are currently not supported and are best implemented
    as integers for now.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you try to define an attribute
    as boolean the program will abort on initialization.&nbsp; The
    reason is that Datascope does no support boolean type directly, but
    boolean like things are stored in the db as single characters (e.g.
    timedef in assoc).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This is a core program to make this package useful for data
    processing.&nbsp; The default parameter file is well suited to
    segmented waveforms produced by the extract_events program I wrote a
    number of years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; It creates 3c bundled data that are
    readily converted to the streams format used by this package of
    programs.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <p><i>-t type<br>
      </i>Use this switch to change the expected type of file to
      process.&nbsp; The default is ThreeComponentEnsemble
      objects.&nbsp; Accepted options at this time are:&nbsp;
      TimeSeries, TimeSeriesEnsemble, and
      ThreeComponentSeismogram.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p><i>-o logfile<br>
      </i>Enables the log file feature and writes the results to
      logfile.&nbsp; The output is a white space separated table of
      attributes with an order defined in the parameter file (see
      below).&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p><i>-pf pffile<br>
      </i>Read pf data from pffile instead of the default of
      dbloadhdr.pf.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <i>-binary<br>
    </i>Write the output in binary.&nbsp; Default is text serialized
    file.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-v<br>
    </i>Be more verbose.&nbsp; Note all log information goes to stderr
    so it is best to use this option only for debugging problems.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Parameter file:</h3>
    <p>The behavior of this program is controlled largely by the
      parameter file.&nbsp; The pf is structured as three &amp;Tbl
      lists:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><i>dbprocess_commands </i>is a series of instructions to the
        Datascope dbprocess procedure (see man
        dbprocess(3)).&nbsp;&nbsp; This set of commands builds the
        working view used for matching to load the right attributes with
        each seismogram.&nbsp; The "verbose" command is highly
        recommended unless you are 100% confident in the integrity of
        your database and what you are doing.</li>
      <li><i>match_keys</i> defines the namespace used to build
        one-to-one matches of attributes currently loaded with each
        seismogram to a row of the view created by
        dbprocess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li><i>attributes_to_load </i>defines the list of database
        attributes to be extracted and loaded with the data.</li>
    </ol>
    The <i>match_keys</i> and <i>attributes_to_load </i>Tbl lists
    share a common format.&nbsp; The concept is to define the type of
    the attribute and provide an optional mapping of datascope attribute
    names (e.g. site.lat) to a more rational internal name key (e.g.
    source_latitude).&nbsp; Each line of both Tbls have are expected to
    have this structure:<i><br>
    </i>
    <blockquote><i>internal_name dbattribute_name db_table type<br>
      </i></blockquote>
    Where<br>
    <blockquote><i>internal_name</i> is the key used to in the
      "Metadata" (header) for this attribute.<br>
      <i>dbattribute_name </i>is the css3.0 attribute name that is to
      be loaded keyed with <i>internal_name. <br>
      </i><i>db_table</i> is the specific table for which the attribute
      is to be loaded.&nbsp; The calls to dbgetv are always expanded to
      <i>dbattribute_name.db_table </i>to avoid ambiguity for
      attributes like time that occur in multiple tables.&nbsp; <br>
      <i>type</i> defines the type of the attribute in the database,
      which is always retained in the output file.&nbsp; Accepted names
      are defined in the following table:<br>
      <table width="100%" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top"><i>Data type</i><br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top"><i>Accepted values to define</i><br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">integer<br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top">int, INT, integer<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">real<br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top">real, REAL, double<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top">string<br>
            </td>
            <td valign="top">string, STRING<br>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
