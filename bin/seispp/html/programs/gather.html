    <h1>gather</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>gather -i key1 key2 ... -s key1 key2 ... [-binary] &lt; in &gt;
      out<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    Assembles a file of serialized ThreeComponentSeismogram objects read
    from stdin into one or more ThreeComponentEnsemble objects that are
    serialized and written to stdout.&nbsp; Grouping that defines the
    ensemble is defined by exact matches of integer and/or string
    keys.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new ensemble is created and written to output
    whenever any of the keys change.&nbsp; It is thus assumed the file
    has been properly sorted before running this program.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-s</i> should precede the list of string keys.<br>
    <i>-i </i>should precede the list of integer keys.<br>
    Note only integer keys, only string keys, and mixes of integer and
    string keys are all allowed.<br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <p><i>-binary<br>
      </i>Switch to binary input and output.&nbsp; Default is text
      format serialized data.&nbsp; The -binary argument must occur as
      the first argument, the last argument, or between the -i and -s
      key lists.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Limitations and Caveats</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>If the gather keys given are not consistent with the order of
        the file the results will likely be garbage.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>If the gather keys never change in a large file a memory fault
        can be generated as the program has not safety valve for large
        ensembles created in error.</li>
      <li>Only exact match grouping is currently supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Defining real number matches, for example, would require range
        matching that would require a different algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        That type of functionality might be easier to implement with a
        prefilter that does more elaborate metadata processing and
        assigns a new integer key that can be handled correctly with
        this program. <br>
