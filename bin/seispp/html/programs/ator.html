    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>ator &lt; in &gt; out [-key key -t objt --help -text -v]<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    A novel feature of the seispp library is a consistent handling of
    absolute and relative time.&nbsp; By absolute time I implicitly mean
    UTC specified as epoch time.&nbsp; The concept, however, is more
    generic.&nbsp; Any time standard that allows data obtained from
    multiple sources to be trusted as following the same standard are
    "absolute".&nbsp; Said another way, absolute time is a clock
    standard.&nbsp; Relative time, in contrast, is not a clock time but
    a time relative to some (unspecified) 0 time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    definitive example is active source data where 0 is shot
    time.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the seispp library, however, another useful
    standard I use a lot is an "arrival time reference" where 0 is the
    predicted or measured time of a "seismic phase" with respect to an
    event hypocenter.&nbsp; The purpose of this program is to convert
    seismograms from absolute to a relative time base.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The time used to define zero is controlled by a time extracted from
    the Metadata (header) of each and every seismogram.&nbsp; The
    default key is "arrival.time".&nbsp; Ensembles (gathers) must be
    passed through <a href="./dismember.html">dismember</a> before
    calling this program or processing will fail because the algorithm
    uses assumes an input stream of single seismogram objects.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <i>-key key<br>
    </i>Use key as parameter defining the epoch time of time 0.&nbsp;
    Default key is arrival.time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Example of alternative
    names that might come from an antelope db are origin.time or
    wfdisc.time.&nbsp; Any name can be used, however, so something
    simpler like t0 could be used provided all seismograms contain that
    attribute with that key.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-t objt<br>
    </i>Use alternative object type <i>objt</i> instead of default
    (ThreeComponentSeismogram).&nbsp; Accepted names are TimeSeries and
    PMTimeSeries.<br>
    <h3> </h3>
    <i>-text<br>
    </i>Write the output in text format. &nbsp; Default is a binary
    serialized file. <br>
    <br>
    <i>-v<br>
    </i>Be more verbose.&nbsp; Note all log information goes to stderr
    so it is best to use this option only for debugging problems.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Parameter file:</h3>
    Many seispp programs have a parameter file option.&nbsp; In this
    section describe the parameter file structure. <br>
