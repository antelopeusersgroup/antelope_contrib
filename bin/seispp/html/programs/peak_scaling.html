    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    This little program scales each member of input
    ThreeComponentEnsemble objects so that the peak amplitude of each
    member is constant.&nbsp; That is, every sample of a seismogram is
    scaled by 1/<i>peak_amplitude</i><i>.&nbsp; </i><i>peak_amplitude</i>
    is defined in a vector sense as the maximum L2 norm of the vector
    amplitude of all samples in each seismogram.&nbsp;&nbsp; Relative
    amplitude of components are thus preserved but the absolute
    amplitude of all the output seismograms is altered by the computed
    peak amplitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; The amplitude scale factor applied is
    preserved in the metadata attribute with the key <i>gain</i>.&nbsp;
    Note that if <i>gain</i> was already defined in the input it will
    be changed to <i>gain/peak_amplitude.&nbsp; </i>If <i>gain</i>
    was not previously assigned the <i>gain</i> attribute will be set
    to 1.0/<i>peak_amplitude.&nbsp; </i>One can then always restore
    data to the original amplitudes from the stored <i>gain </i>attribute.

    Note that this program currently ONLY works with serialized
    ThreeComponentEnsemble objects. &nbsp; <br>
