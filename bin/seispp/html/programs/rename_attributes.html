    <h1>rename_attributes</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>rename_attributes &lt; in &gt; out [-t object_type -v --help
      -text -pf pffile]<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    A novel feature of the seispp library is that the namespace used for
    defining header (Metadata) attributes is not fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    keys used to access any attribute related to a data object can be
    anything the user wants it to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although general that
    complicates the problem of mapping to an external namespace such as
    that used by seismic unix required for a program like export_to_su.
    &nbsp; The purpose of this program is to provide a map one namespace
    to another. &nbsp; (e.g. rename_attributes &lt; infile |
    rename_attributes | export_to_su outfile.su).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Attributes can be either copied so the original name tag is
    retained, or moved (renamed). &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This program will throw an error message to stderr and blunder on if
    a requested attribute is not found in the header of an object in the
    input file. &nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid awkward two pass processing with
    tons of error messages on one pass or the other, always set
    attributes to be copied&nbsp; (not renamed) unless you are sure
    every single object has an attribute defined. &nbsp; &nbsp; For this
    reason the general guidance is to normally copy any attribute rather
    than rename it as the increase in file size for copying is
    negligible unless the edit definition is large. <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <p><i>-t objt<br>
      </i>Set the object type of data file to process.&nbsp; Default is
      ThreeComponentSeismogram.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported type are:&nbsp;
      TimeSeries, TimeSeriesEnsemble,&nbsp; and
      ThreeComponentEnsemble.&nbsp; Note that for ensembles the edits
      are made to the ensemble metadata, NOT individual seismogram
      inside the ensmble.<br>
    </p>
    <i>-text</i><br>
    Write the output in text format.&nbsp;  Default is a binary serialized file.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-v<br>
    </i>Be more verbose.&nbsp; Note all log information goes to stderr
    so it is best to use this option only for debugging problems.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>-pf pffile<br>
    </i>Use pffile instead of default rename_attributes.pf.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Parameter file:</h3>
    What attributes are changed in the processing is completely
    controlled by the parameter file. The parameter file requires only a
    single &amp;Tbl entry with the tag <i>edit_list</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Each line of the <i>edit_list</i> Tbl&amp; is assumed to hold three
    string tokens separated by white space:<br>
    <blockquote>mode&nbsp; oldname newname type<br>
    </blockquote>
    The <i>mode</i> entry must be either <i>copy</i> or <i>rename</i>.&nbsp;
    The program will exit with an error message if this token is
    anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; If mode is set to <i>rename</i> the
    original entry with the old key is deleted.&nbsp; In <i>copy</i>
    mode a second copy of the attribute is posted to the object. <br>
    <br>
    <i>oldname</i> and <i>newname </i>are the old and new keys used to
    defined the requested attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp; In copy mode the output
    will have two copies of the attribute accessible with both oldname
    and newname.&nbsp; In rename mode only newname will be present in
    the output.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The <i>type</i> token defines the data type of the associated
    attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only basic data types are
    allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; For integer attributes this field must be one
    of the following:&nbsp; int, INT, or integer.&nbsp; For floating
    point attributes this field must be one of the following:&nbsp; real
    REAL, float or double. &nbsp; For strings&nbsp; this field must be
    one of the following:&nbsp; string or STRING.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boolean
    attributes are defined by one of the following:&nbsp; bool, boolean,
    or BOOL.&nbsp; <br>
