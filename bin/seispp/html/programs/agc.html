    <h1>AGC</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>agc windlength [-g gainfunction] &lt; infile &gt; outfile<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    <p>This is a three-component agc operator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithm
      was stolen from seismic unix, but extended to three-component
      data.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means the moving rms window used to define
      the gain function is computed from the vector magnitude of each
      sample rather than the scale rms used for stock seismic reflection
      data handled by seismic unix.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Options:<br>
    </h3>
    <p>The required argument windlength defines the agc window length in
      seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; No sanity checks are made on this parameter.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>If the&nbsp; -g option is specified the computed gain functions
      for each seismogram are saved as serialized TimeSeriesEnsemble
      objects to the file defined by the argument that follows the -g
      flag (gainfunction in the usage line). <br>
