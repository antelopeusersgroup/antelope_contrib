    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>export_to_matlab [-v -text -o outfile] &lt; in <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    The purpose of this program is to export a single TimeSeriesObject
    as a matrix that can be read by the load procedure in matlab. Output
    matrix has individual time series data in the columns of the matrix.
    The matrix is a simple text file that can be read in matlab with
    load(file,'-ascii').&nbsp; The algorithm used requires all data in
    the ensemble have the same nominal sample rate.&nbsp; It will exit
    if the range of sample intervals is by more than 0.1 ms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Start and end times can be irregular.&nbsp; When that happens the
    data will be silently zero padded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program computes
    the earliest start time and lastest end time in the ensemble.&nbsp;
    Any seismogram whose start and end time do not match those times
    within one sample will be zero padded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The start time
    computed this way and the size of the output matrices are written to
    stderr when the -v option is used (otherwise the program is
    silent).&nbsp; The program avoids extreme blunders by checking the
    number of samples against a fixed internal wall size (currently 100
    million samples).&nbsp; It will exit if the computed number of
    samples exceeds this size, but otherwise it will blunder forward
    blindly.&nbsp; If you get gigantic output files it likely means the
    ensemble has a large range of UTC times instead of a small range of
    times relative to some other time standard (i.e. the implict
    assumption is that the input ensemble is a fixed time window or
    something like a common receiver gather with relative times set by
    something like predicted P arrival times.).<br>
    <h3>File Format</h3>
    <p>The output is a text format with the seismograms stored in the
      colums of the matrix and one input line per time step.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      This allows the matrix to be read with a variant of this command
      in matlab:<br>
      d=load('seismograms.dat','-ascii');<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    -v <br>
    Turns on verbose mode.&nbsp; Key thing with this program is that
    when set the start time of each seismogram will be posted to stdout.<br>
    <br>
    -text <br>
    Input is expected to be a boost serialized text file.&nbsp; Default
    is binary format.<br>
    <br>
    -o outfile<br>
    Write the results to outfile.&nbsp; By default the output is sent to
    stdout.&nbsp; <br>
