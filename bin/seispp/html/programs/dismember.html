    <h1>dismember</h1>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>dismember [-scalar -binary] &lt; infile &gt; outfile<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    Break ensembles into member seismograms.&nbsp; In the seispp library
    an ensemble is a group of objects bundled and stored in an
    std::vector container.&nbsp;&nbsp; In seispp the objects are either
    scalar or vector (three-component) seismograms.&nbsp; It is
    sometimes useful to ungroup the ensembles.&nbsp; This does that and
    writes an ungroup set of member objects to output.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    -<i>scalar </i>- Assume input is TimeSeriesEnsemble objects so
    output will be a series of TimeSeries objects.&nbsp; Default is
    ThreeComponentEnsemble and ThreeComponentSeismograms respectively.<br>
    <i>-binary </i>- assume binary format for input and output (default
    is text format)<i></i><br>
