    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    Rotation of three-component seismograms is a fundamental
    functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a relatively generic program to
    apply a suite of possible rotation operators implemented in the
    seispp library.&nbsp; Options are:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Constant transformation - rotate all data by specified
        spherical coordinate angles<br>
      </li>
      <li>ZRT - rotate around Z axis (changing only horizontal
        components)<br>
      </li>
      <li>LQT - rotate to orthogonal LQT coordinates (L - longitudinal,
        Q - radial, and T - transverse).&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li>FST - Kennett's free surface transformation
        operator.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Rotation operators can be set as a constant for all data in the file
    or basic on computed from event information stored as trace
    attributes.&nbsp; Computed transformations to LQT or FST require
    input of an assumed surface P and S wave velocity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Primary control for all the options comes through a parameter file
    described below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    This program only accepts serialized ThreeComponentEnsemble
    objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the constant transformation is selected,
    these are also assumed to be common source gathers with source
    information stored in the ensemble metadata and receiver coordinates
    defined in the metadata for each seismogram.&nbsp; <br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <i>-text</i><br>
    Write the output in text format.&nbsp;  Default is a binary serialized file.<br>
    <br>
    <i>--help</i><br>
    Print the usage message<br>
    <br>
    <i>-accumulate</i><br>
    This flag will cause the program to apply the requested
    transformation to the data without checking. Default is to force all
    data to cardinal directions before applying the requested
    transformations.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-pf pffile<br>
    </i>When present the program will read from parameter file pf
    instead of the default rotate.pf.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Parameter file</h3>
    The top-level behavior of this program should be thought of as a
    switch controlled by the boolean parameter <i>constant_transformation.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    When true the program ignore everything else and apply a constant
    transformation vector to all data.&nbsp; In this case it will
    extract two&nbsp; parameters:&nbsp; (1) <i>phi</i> should be set to
    the counterclockwise angle (in degrees) to rotate around the Z axis
    (x1 axis is always east unless the -accumulate flag is used and the
    data were not originally cardinal), and (2) <i>theta </i>should
    define the angle to rotate around the <i>phi</i> rotated x2 axis,
    which is equivalent to the zonal angle in standard spherical
    coordinates.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those familiar with spherical
    coordinates the transformation is equivalent to that to transform
    from standard coordinates to the basis vectors of spherical
    coordinates at a point r, theta, phi.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    When <i>constant_transformation </i>is false the most important
    parameter for this program has the key <i>rotation_type</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    It must have one of three values with definitions defined
    above:&nbsp; ZRT, LQT, or FST.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is anything else
    the program will abort with a diagnostic message.&nbsp; All of these
    modes assume some form ray-based transformations computed for each
    seismogram.&nbsp; They thus require the program to<i> </i>know both
    source and receiver geographic coordinates.&nbsp; Source coordinates
    are expected to be found in the ensemble's metadata.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    parameter file defines the keys used to fetch these
    coordinates.&nbsp; The keywords in the parameter file that define
    these are:&nbsp; <i>event_latitude_key, event_longitude_key, </i>and<i>
      event_depth_key.&nbsp; </i>Defaults for these are Antelope
    database names that would be used to extract them:&nbsp; origin.lat,
    origin.lon, and origin.depth respectively. &nbsp;<i> </i>Receiver
    coordinates must be defined for each member seismogram of the input
    ensemble.&nbsp; The program will try to extract source and receiver
    latitudes (in degrees) from each seismogram using the keys defined
    in the parameter file with these tags:&nbsp; <i>station_latitude_key

    </i>and<i> station_longitude_key </i>(defaults are site.lat and
    site.lon).&nbsp; <br>
    <i><br>
    </i>ZRT defines the simplest transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It defines
    the R direction from a great circle path calculation that requires
    only source and receiver latitudes and longitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    ZRT is selected the output seismograms will all be rotated with x1
    in the R direction, x2 in the T direction, and x3 in the Z direction
    (unaltered). <br>
    <br>
    LQT and FST are both forms of a ray-coordinate transformation.&nbsp;
    An earth model is necessary to define the geometry of the incident
    wave used to define the transformation.&nbsp; This program uses
    Antelope's generic travel time calculator (man ttcalc(3)) that
    require two parameters that must be defined in the parameter
    file:&nbsp; <i>ttmethod </i>and<i> ttmodel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>See
    the manual page for ttcalc(3) for a description of how these are
    used and limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Default is tttaup and iasp91
    respectively.&nbsp; Both LQT and FST require a surface velocity to
    define ray geometry at the station.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program gets
    these from the parameter file through two keys:&nbsp; <i>vp0 </i>and<i>
      vs0.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>As the names imply the first is the
    assumed surface P wave velocity and the second is the assumed
    surface S wave velocity.&nbsp; Note only the first is used for LQT,
    but both are required for FST.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defaults are 6.2 and 3.5
    respectively.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The LQT transformation is orthogonal and transforms x1 to radial
    (Q), x2&nbsp; to tranverse (T), and x3 to longitudinal
    (L).&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that unless the -accumulate flag is used the
    program will force the data back to cardinal directions using the
    <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_three_component_seismogram.html">
      rotate_to_standard</a> method<b> </b>of the
    ThreeComponentSeismogram objects before applying the
    transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp; That guarantees the initial orientation
    before the LQT transformation is applied is ENZ (x1 positive east,
    x2 positive north, and x3 positive up).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    program derives the azimuthal angle for the transformation the same
    as ZRT from a great circle path calculation.&nbsp; The theta
    rotation computes the P wave slowness vector from the earth model
    defined by <i>ttmethod </i>and<i> ttmodel.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>It
    then computes the emergence angle, theta, from Snell's law using <i>vp0</i>.&nbsp;

    <br>
    <br>
    FST is similar to LQT, but transforms the data into a coordinate
    system that is not orthogonal.&nbsp;&nbsp; See e.g. Kennett (1991 -
    GJI) or Reading et al. (2003, GRL).&nbsp;&nbsp; For practical
    purposes&nbsp; the primary difference here is that because FST
    includes the distortion effects of P to S conversions at the free
    surface, it&nbsp; requires both the surface S wave velocity defined
    through the parameter <i>vs0 </i>and the surface P wave velocity
    defined by <i>vp0</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; See sources above for the
    background theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise it puts the data in a
    form conceptually similar to LQT.&nbsp; That is, x1 becomes SV
    (radial), x2 becomes SH (transverse), and x3 becomes P
    (longitudinal).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
