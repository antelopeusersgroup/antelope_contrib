    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    The dbxcor program in the Antelope package uses cross-correlation
    and a robust stacking method to do a form of array processing that
    does not depend upon the plane wave approximation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    main output of dbxcor is a set of database tables with arrival times
    estimated by the cross-correlation and picking procedure.&nbsp; That
    table also contains the weights used to compute the robust
    stack.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program saves a version of the array stack
    (beam) used for the correlation, but that waveform is always too
    short to be useful for any subsequent waveform
    processing.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, one might want to use the array
    beam from a small aperture array like a low noise single
    station.&nbsp; Time windowing parameters to define the output
    waveform extent come from the parameter file.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The database view formed by this program is this join:&nbsp;
    xcorarrival-&gt;xcorbeam-&gt;evlink-&gt;event-&gt;origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Note that evid and orid are loaded with each seismogram along with
    the hypocenter information stored as the attributes origin.lat,
    origin.lon, origin.depth, and origin.time.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Output is a serialized file of ThreeComponentEnsemble
    objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seismograms always saved in cardinal
    directions.&nbsp;&nbsp; For large arrays this can be
    inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; A stack to something like LQT coordinates
    is not currently supported.&nbsp; Waveform segments of all stations
    with entries in the xcorarrival are saved in the output along with a
    simple stack and a robust stack of those seismograms.<br>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    <i>-s subset<br>
    </i>This optional flag will apply subset condition to the input
    database view.&nbsp;&nbsp; See Antelope documentation for the syntax
    of the subset condition.<br>
    <br>
    <i>-filter<br>
    </i>When this flag appears the program will read the BRTT filter
    string stored in the xcorbeam table and apply that filter to the
    data before stacking.&nbsp; If this option is used make sure the
    time window parameters are appropriate to remove the filter
    transients on window edges.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>-text</i><br>
    Write the output in text format.&nbsp;  Default is a binary serialized file.<br>
    <i>-v<br>
    </i>Be more verbose.&nbsp; Note all log information goes to stderr
    so it is best to use this option only for debugging problems.<br>
    <br>
    --<i>help<br>
    </i>Echo the usage line.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <i>-pf pffile<br>
    </i>Use pffile instead of default dbxcor_import.pf.<br>
    <h3>Parameter File<br>
    </h3>
    <i>Time Windowing Parameters</i><br>
    <p>Time windowing in this program is a two stage process. &nbsp; The
      program reads a waveform segment with a time starting at <i>read_window_start_relative_time
      </i>and ending at <br>
      <i>read_window_end_relative_time </i>from the absolute time
      defined for each station in the xcorarrival table.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
      the -filter option is used it is applied to this waveform
      segment.&nbsp; The daa are then cut down to the time window
      defined by the two parameters <i>stack_window_start_time</i> and<br>
      <i>stack_window_end_time.&nbsp; </i>The stack window parameters
      must define a shorter time window than the read window
      parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the filter option is applied the read
      window should be large enough relative to the stack time to remove
      edge transients from all filters defined in the input database
      tables.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p><i>Beam Station Names<br>
      </i>Seismologists commonly use the concept of a station name to
      define a particular seismogram.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two parameters
      control how the <i>sta</i> attribute is set in the output.&nbsp;
      <i>simple_beam_sta</i> defines the station name assigned to the
      straight stack (average).&nbsp; <i>robust_beam_sta</i> does the
      same for the robust stacked (weighted stack using weights stored
      in the xcorarrival table).<br>
    </p>
    <i>StationChannelMap</i><br>
    The program uses a seispp library concept of a "<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_station_channel_map.html">StationChannelMap</a>"
    to sort out the complexity of modern broadband seismic instruments
    that almost always have multiple sample rates and sometimes have
    multiple sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of how this parameter
    should be specified can be found in the man page for the Antelope
    contrib program dbxcor (see parameter file section and search for
    StationChannelMap - the format here is identical).&nbsp;
