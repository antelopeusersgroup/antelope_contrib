    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>export_to_matlab_3C [-x1 x1f -x2 x2f -x3 x3f -pf pffile] &lt; in<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Algorithm:</h3>
    The purpose of this program is to export a single
    ThreeComponentEnsemble as three parallel matrices easily read into
    matlab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the three matrices are written to
    separate files. &nbsp; Defaults for the file names are defined in
    the parameter file export_to_matlab.pf. &nbsp; Alternatively, use
    the command line arguments -x1, -x2, and/or -x3 to change output
    file names.&nbsp; Default output file names are 'T.dat' for
    component 1, 'R.dat' for component 2, and 'L.dat' for component
    3.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The algorithm used requires all data in the ensemble have the same
    nominal sample rate.&nbsp; It will exit if the range of sample
    intervals is by more than 0.1 ms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Start and end times
    can be irregular.&nbsp; When that happens the data will be silently
    zero padded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program computes the earliest start
    time and lastest end time in the ensemble.&nbsp; Any seismogram
    whose start and end time do not match those times within one sample
    will be zero padded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The start time computed this way
    and the size of the output matrices are written to stdout in a log
    record.&nbsp; The program avoids extreme blunders by checking the
    number of samples against a fixed internal wall size (currently 100
    million samples).&nbsp; It will exit the computed number of samples
    exceeds this size, but otherwise it will blunder forward
    blindly.&nbsp; If you get gigantic output files it likely means the
    ensemble has a large range of UTC times instead of a small range of
    times relative to some other time standard (i.e. the implict
    assumption is that the input ensemble is a fixed time window or
    something like a common receiver gather with relative times set by
    something like predicted P arrival times.).<br>
    <h3>File Format</h3>
    <p>In the input ThreeComponentEnsemble object, seismograms are
      stored as a vector of ThreeComponentSeismogram objects that each
      store three-component seismogramsa as a 3 by ns (number of
      samples) matrix.&nbsp; This program rearranges that data into
      three M by N matrix where M=ns (number of samples as described
      above) and N is the number of seismograms in the input
      ensemble.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these matrices is the data from one
      component extracted from the enemble.&nbsp;&nbsp; Output file
      names are controlled by the -x1, -x2, and -x3 command line options
      or the pf file defaults.&nbsp; Each file is a text file of one of
      these matrices written in the visual order (i.e. each row of the
      matrix is written in one line with a newline terminator).&nbsp;
      Each of these matrices is then easily read by the load command in
      matlab.&nbsp; This would be a proto section of an m-file to read
      these:<br>
      T=load('T.dat','-ascii');<br>
      R=load('R.dat','-ascii');<br>
      L=load('L.dat','-ascii');<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Options:</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
    Use the -x1, -x2, and -x3 options to change the default output
    matrix file names.<br>
    <br>
    Use -pf to read from parameter file pffile instead of the default
    export_to_matlab.pf.<br>
