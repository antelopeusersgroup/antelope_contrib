    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>This library was developed as a response to my frustration with
      poor and archaic support of all existing seismology applications
      for three-component seismograms.&nbsp; A decade earlier I had
      started writing analysis code in C++.&nbsp;&nbsp; During that
      process I developed a series of basic seismology data objects
      including:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_time_series.html">TimeSeries</a>,&nbsp;


















      <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_three_component_seismogram.html">ThreeComponentSeismograms</a>,
      <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_time_series_ensemble.html">ThreeComponentEnsemble,</a>
      and <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_time_series_ensemble.html">TimeSeriesEnsemble</a>
      C++ classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were components of an open source
      library I developed over the next decade distributed through the <a
        href="http://www.antelopeusersgroup.org/repository/">antelope
        user's group</a> as a library I called libseispp (seismic
      C-plus-plus).&nbsp; In late 2015 I discovered an elegant library
      in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> suite of C++
      software for serialization. &nbsp; Serialization is an abstraction
      that allows very complex objects to be written and restored to
      storage with a simple constract, which in the case of boost
      serialization are overloads of the &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; operators
      respectively. &nbsp; (python progammers will recognize
      serialization by the standard module called <a
        href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle">pickle</a>).<br>
    </p>
    <p>A second key concept behind this package is the general idea of a
      unix filter and the application of that more general concept in
      the package called <a href="http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes/">seismic


















        unix</a>.&nbsp; In many respects this package should be thought
      of as a three-component seismogram version of seismic unix with
      boost serialization as the core external format instead of the
      seismic unix format, which is a variant of <a
href="http://www.seg.org/Portals/0/SEG/News%20and%20Resources/Technical%20Standards/seg_y_rev1.pdf">SEGY</a>.&nbsp;


















      That means it shares the intrinsic scalability limitations of unix
      pipelines in modern massively parallel systems, but is vastly
      superior to data handling in <a
        href="http://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/">Seismic Analysis
        Code (SAC)</a> and <a href="https://docs.obspy.org/">ObsPy</a>
      that tend to fragment data sets into overwhelming numbers of files
      (one file per time series for SAC and one file per ensemble the
      stock best cast for ObsPy).&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the
      boost serialization framework on which this library is based,
      which is defined in a template library called seispp_io.h, was
      designed to be extendible to an abstraction of the MPI
      foreman/worker model for cluster processing.&nbsp; Time will tell
      if that is ever developed, so I took the perspective to make it
      work before you make it fast.&nbsp; I thus decided to begin with
      the tried and true idea of unix pipelines.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>The C++ classes on which the programs in this package are based
      all make use of a generic "header" interface made part of the
      seismic data object by inheritance of the C++ class <a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_metadata.html">SEISPP::Metadata</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;


















      This Metadata class is a generic way to store attributes indexed
      as key-value pairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; At present the atributes can only
      be stock, standard, data type:&nbsp; integers (always stored as C
      long int), real numbers (always stored as C double), strings
      (always stored as std::string objects), and booleans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      There are get and put template methods that can be used to handle
      variants of these basic types (e.g. put&lt;short int&gt; and
      put&lt;char *&gt;), but if you elect to extend this package avoid
      anything but the internal data types.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
      currently minimal tools to validate attributes in a large data
      file because future developments are at a design stage to utilize
      a database to handle that generic problem more efficiently. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, it is worth noting the seispp library has a concept any
      user of this package must understand.&nbsp; I consider some type
      of time series related object as atomic. &nbsp; The seispp library
      implements three:&nbsp; TimeSeries, ThreeComponentSeismogram, and
      ComplexTimeSeries classes.&nbsp; I have a more exotic extension
      under developement I call a PMTimeSeries (Particle Motion Time
      Series) object that defines instantaneous particle motion ellipses
      at equal time steps. &nbsp; All are children of the virtual base
      class&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_basic_time_series.html">BasicTimeSeries</a>.
      &nbsp; These atomic objects are used to define what I call an <i><u>ensemble</u></i>.&nbsp;


















      The core version for this set of modules is a&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_three_component_ensemble.html">ThreeComponentEnsemble</a>
      which define a generic collection of (atomic)
      ThreeComponentSeismogram objects managed in this implementation
      with and std::vector container. &nbsp; I violate textbook advice
      on object design and make this container part of the public
      interface.&nbsp; That was done intentionally to improve
      efficiency, but has an undeniable dark side.&nbsp; Browse the
      source code for this group of programs,&nbsp;<a
href="https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/tree/master/bin/seispp">which


















        can be found at this url</a>, to see examples of how to
      manipulate data in a ThreeComponentEnsemble object.&nbsp; A key
      point is that the use of a vector container means the natural
      index to members of the ensemble is an integer. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h2>File Format</h2>
    <p>A key point of the serialization concept is that the details of
      the format is something the end user does not need to know at
      all.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a general concept that has formed a core
      concept in computer science since the earliest days of computer
      programming.&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. even in ancient FORTRAN a statement
      like read(5,1000) x,y,z&nbsp; hides a lot of details from the
      programmer.&nbsp;&nbsp; A more modern example is a command like
      this in matlab: (1) save 'mydata.mat'&nbsp; to write matlab data,
      and (2) load 'mydata.mat' to read that data back in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      boost's serialization library is simply a more generic way to
      accomplish the same concept for C++ objects.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>A limitation of the current implementation of boost's
      serialization library, however, is that it seems to have been
      written with the concept of one object being stored to one file or
      a suite of objects always being written in a fixed
      format.&nbsp;&nbsp; I say that because it has no clean way to
      define end of information in a boost serialization
      stream.&nbsp;&nbsp; In an early prototypes of this package I
      handled this with a exception handler, but I considered it both
      dangerous and intrinsically wrong to handle an end of file
      condition on a read as an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; A key design
      concept was an extensible file format that could range in scale
      from one object to billions or more.&nbsp; To do that I used a
      tried and true method of a line sentinel.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the
      files used by these modules are not pure boost serialization
      files, but individual objects in the file are separate by magic
      string sentinels that tell a reader that more data is available of
      this is the end of the file.&nbsp;&nbsp; That allows generic read
      loops like the following:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>StreamObjectReader&lt;ThreeComponentEnsemble&gt; inpfs;<br>
      StreamObjectWriter&lt;ThreeComponentEnsemble&gt; outfs;<br>
      ThreeComponentEnsemble d;<br>
      while(inpsf.good())<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; d=inpfs.read();<br>
      &nbsp; -- algorithm to alter d here --<br>
      &nbsp; outfs.write(d);<br>
      }<br>
    </blockquote>
    This is a simplified version of the code in the <a
href="https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/blob/master/bin/seispp/template/template.cc">template</a>
    module that shows how to read one of these files from stdin and
    write the results to stdout.&nbsp; This is an example the modern
    computer science concept of using an API to abstracts access to data
    (i.e. like save and load in matlab). &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The full description of this API can be found in the doxygen pages
    for the seispp_io library (This is the&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_stream_object_reader.html">reader</a>.&nbsp;


    This is the&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.indiana.edu/%7Epavlab/software/seispp/html/class_s_e_i_s_p_p_1_1_stream_object_writer.html">writer.</a>)
    &nbsp; The default serialization is a binary format.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This was found important for efficiency as the text format is at
    least and order of magnitude slower for reading and writing than the
    binary version.&nbsp;&nbsp; Text format files could be useful for
    transport between machines, but this will require implementing a
    feature in the library to allow this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, use the
    binary format unless you need to try debug the file format.<br>
    <br>
    A final very important point is that a StreamObject file, which is
    the abstraction used here,&nbsp; can contain only one type of of
    object.&nbsp;&nbsp; A file made up of an unspecified number of
    something would make no sense if the somethings changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    To do so would have required additional baggage that I viewed as
    only adding unnecessary complications and overhead.<br>
    <h2>Extensibility</h2>
    <p>My hope is that others will be able to extend this package by
      adding new modules.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unix filter concept is
      familiar to almost all seismologists, but C++ is a foreign
      language to most.&nbsp;&nbsp; To make this more approachable the
      package includes a <a
href="https://github.com/antelopeusersgroup/antelope_contrib/blob/master/bin/seispp/template/template.cc">template</a>
      module.&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual code, template.cc, does nothing but
      count the number of ensembles in a file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments in
      the template.cc code and the makefiles should allow anyone with a
      knowledge of C to implement an alternative algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;
