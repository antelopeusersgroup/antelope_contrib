.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple script to perform a crude calibration comparison of co-located
strong-motion and broadband instruments. Velocity data is demeaned,
differentiated to cast data to units of acceleration and then frequency filtered
to remove signal outside the instrument passband. Accleration data is demeaned
and the same frequency filter is applied. These processed time-series are plotted
separately and superimposed for visual comparison. This method is sufficient for
determining significant calibration errors (eg. factors of 2, 4...) and is not
intended for high-precision instrument calibration.
