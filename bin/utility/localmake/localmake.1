.SH NAME
localmake \- build subsections of the Antelope-contrib code base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
localmake [-c] [-v] [-l] [-p pfname] [-s src_subdir] [-t] module
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBlocalmake\fP program is designed to build and install coherent
subsections of the Antelope contributed-code software base, usually to 
support the installation of one particular Antelope-contrib program or 
one particular Antelope-contrib software library or interface. 

If the \fBlocalmake\fP program is given a \fImodule\fP name, it will 
recompile all the parts of the specified \fImodule\fP (as detailed in 
the \fBlocalmake\fP parameter file) on which a particular software 
component depends. If the \fI-t\fP option is used, \fBlocalmake\fP will 
further assemble the resulting compiled components into a platform-specific
tar file which may be distributed for use on identically configured 
machines elsewhere. Depending on the components being compiled and how 
their makefiles are structured, the location into which results are 
installed may be $ANTELOPE/local rather than $ANTELOPE. 

When running in GUI mode, the log of a particular compilation run, as shown in
the main \fBlocalmake\fP window, may be saved to a file with the 
\fIFile->Save compile log as...\fP button. This may be useful if compilation problems 
occur which one needs to share with the author of the code in question for help with resolution.  

When the \fBlocalmake\fP GUI is launched in configuration mode, it presents a
notebook-tabbed panel for each potentially available \fIcapability\fP.
The most important button on each panel is the one to \fIEnable\fP
or \fIDisable\fP the \fIcapability\fP in question. After a
\fIcapability\fP is enabled, the next step is to fill in the required
macro values to support that \fIcapability\fP. These are presented
as labelled entry-boxes, one entry-box for each necessary macro
value. Balloon help is available for each entry box with a basic
description of what the value describes. For more detailed help,
an \fIExplain\fP button to the right of each entry box describes
in more detail how the entry should be filled.

When a \fIcapability\fP is enabled, \fBlocalmake\fP runs
tests (as configured in \fIlocalmake.pf\fP) to ensure the
macro values are OK and other necessary components are in place.
Generally these tests are fairly rudimentary, however important to
check as they determine whether \fBlocalmake\fP will allow
software elements to compile during the build process when they
depend on the \fIcapability\fP in question. When macro values are
changed, the tests are re-run.  The bottom of the GUI panel for
each \fIcapability\fP shows the status of the tests for the given
\fIcapability\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c 
Launch in configure mode instead of compile mode.
.IP -l
Print a list of available modules and exit. 
.IP "-s subdirectory"
This parameter overrides the \fIsrc_subdir\fP parameter in the parameter file. For further details, 
see the PARAMETER FILE section below. 
.IP -v 
Run in verbose mode.
.IP "-p pfname"
Specify an alternate parameter file.
.IP -t
Create a tarball of the compiled \fImodule\fP and files on which it depends.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.SS "Parameter explanations"
.IP tarball_time_format
This parameter specifies the time format (in the format of epoch2str(3))
to be used in naming tar files with compiled code after it has been built. 
.IP tar_command
This parameter specifies the name of the command to be used to create tar files
.IP make_command
This parameter specifies the make command to use in building targets. The environment variable
named MAKE will take precedence over this if defined. 
.IP <module_name>
The parameter file should contain one parameter-file array (see pf(5)) for each software 
module to be built. The array for a given module describes how to build the module and if
desired how to package it (e.g. in a tarball with the \fI-t\fP option). The name of 
each array should be a unique, descriptive name for the software module. The values 
are arrays with the parameters for how to build and package each module. [Note that the 
angle brackets are used here just to indicate that this parameter's actual name is 
chosen by the user or programmer for the given software module; these angle brackets should 
not appear in localmake.pf itself].
.IP "<module_name>{product}"
This parameter file entry specifies the top-level directory to which the modules being 
built are being directed. For example, for the Antelope contributed-code, the \fIproduct\fP
parameter will be the same as the \fI$ANTELOPE\fP environment variable. 
.IP "<module_name>{capabilities_required}"
This parameter file entry specifies the \fBlocalmake\fP \fIcapabilities\fP which need to be 
enabled in order to compile this module. 
.IP "<module_name>{src_subdir}"
This parameter specifies the top-level sub-directory in which to
find source-code for the entire software distribution out of which
the module comes.  Usually it is a path relative to the destination
(e.g. \fI$ANTELOPE\fP) in which the results will be installed. For
example, for the Antelope contributed-code repository, a common
value for \fIsrc_subdir\fP would be \fIsrc/contrib\fP to indicate
source-code stored in the directory \fI$ANTELOPE/src/contrib\fP.
In this normal case, the destination directory (\fI$ANTELOPE\fP)
will be prepended to the \fIsrc_subdir\fP value in order to find
the necessary source-code during compilation.  If the \fIsrc_subdir\fP
parameter is an absolute path, it is treated as such and no other
absolute path is prepended. The \fIsrc_subdir\fP assignment may be
overridden on the command-line with the \fI-s\fP option.
.IP "<module_name>{build}"
This parameter is a table of directories relative to $ANTELOPE containing the 
source code for the software \fImodule\fP and all of its dependencies (although 
if any of the directory names begins with a '/' character it is assumed to be 
an absolute path, and $ANTELOPE is not prepended). When 
\fBlocalmake\fP is told to build a given software package, it enters each of 
these directories in turn and executes 'make install'. 
.IP "<module_name>{package}"
This parameter is a table of files relative to $ANTELOPE containing 
all pieces of compiled code and supporting files comprising a given software
\fImodule\fP. 
.IP antelope
This is a convenient \fIplain reference\fP (see pf(5)) in the parameter file used 
to record the current Antelope version. 
.IP capabilities
Each distinct external dependency controlled by \fBlocalmake\fP is given 
a unique \fIcapability\fP name, and configured in the \fIcapabilities\fP 
Array of the \fBlocalmake\fP parameter file. The key into this array is the
name of the \fIcapability\fP. Each named \fIcapability\fP has its own sub-array
with the following values:
.IP capabilities{enable}
This is an array with booleans for each platform (\fIDarwin\fP, \fILinux\fP, 
and \fISunOS\fP), specifying whether or not to attempt compilation (contingent on
successfully passing tests) assuming the existence of this \fIcapability\fP. Generally, the 
\fIenable\fP values in \fIlocalmake.pf\fP should be left set to 0, with the actual values for a 
given platform configured in \fIlocalmake.pf\fP. Due to coding limitations, the 
booleans should be given explicitly as 0 or 1 (rather than "yes", "no", "true", etc.) so they are parsed 
correctly.
.IP capabilities{required_macros}
This Table lists the macros required to be defined for this \fIcapability\fP.
.IP capabilities{tests}
This Table contains one or more parameter-file \fI&Literal\fP values 
(as documented in pf(5)), containing perl code to execute a test 
to make sure the \fIcapability\fP is properly configured. The perl code must 
evaluate to a perl \fItrue\fP value for the test to be 
considered successful. Each test should also define two strings called
\fI$failure_msg\fP and \fI$success_msg\fP containing short 
messages to the user explaining the results of the test. 
.IP capabilities{Description}
This parameter is a short text description of what the \fIcapability\fP entails. 
.IP capabilities{Detail}
This parameter is a longer, detailed text description of what the \fIcapability\fP entails. 
.IP dest
The \fIdest\fP parameter specifies the directory into which the automatically generated
makefile rules will be placed. 
.IP extra_rules
In addition to locally configured macros, there may be extra rules necessary for
local compilation (such as dot rules for script extensions that invoke template(1), 
for example). These extra make rules are listed in the \fIextra_rules\fP 
\fI&Literal\fP parameter. 
.IP header
This parameter-file \fI&Literal\fP contains the message to put at the top of the local
make rules file. Usually, this is a warning about not modifying the file by hand, rather
using \fBlocalmake\fP. 
.IP macros
Each makefile \fImacro\fP that may be of use in compiling Antelope-contrib code 
against external utilities is described
in the \fImacros\fP Array of the \fBlocalmake\fP parameter file. 
The key into the \fImacros\fP array is the name of the \fImacro\fP. Generally, these values 
should be left blank in \fIlocalmake.pf\fP, unless the locations are so standard on a given 
platform that leaving non-blank values proves a convenience rather than an inconvenience to 
all users. The actual values for these macros will be configured in \fIlocalmake.pf\fP
for each system. Each named \fImacro\fP has its own sub-array with the following values:
.IP macros{Darwin}
The \fIDarwin\fP sub-parameter gives the configured value of the \fImacro\fP 
on Macintosh systems.
.IP macros{Linux}
The \fILinux\fP sub-parameter gives the configured value of the \fImacro\fP 
on Linux systems.
.IP macros{SunOS}
The \fISunOS\fP sub-parameter gives the configured value of the \fImacro\fP 
on Solaris systems.
.IP macros{Description}
This parameter gives a one-line text description of the \fImacro\fP
.IP macros{Detail}
This parameter gives a longer text paragraph explaining the \fImacro\fP and
examples of some possible values on different systems. 
.IP output_file
The \fIoutput_file\fP parameter gives the filename (without directory path)
of the local Antelope make rules automatically generated
based on \fIlocalmake.pf\fP.

                     The PHP_EXECUTABLE macro specifies the absolute 
                     pathname of the PHP interpreter to be used for
                     the Antelope PHP interface. The PHP_INC
                     and PHP_EXECUTABLE macros must be set consistent 
                     with each other, i.e. referring to PHP header files 
                     and PHP executable that belong together. An example 
                     value for the PHP_EXECUTABLE macro might be '/usr/bin/php', although
                     this of course depends on local system configuration.

        Description        Location of PHP header files
        Detail        &Literal{
                     The PHP_INC macro specifies the location of 
                     the include files (header files) for the PHP 
                     interpreter to be used with Antelope (and against which 
                     the Antelope interface to PHP will compile locally). 
                     The directory specified by this macro should contain, 
                     among other things, the sub-directories Zend/, TSRM/, and include/ 
                     (at least for versions of PHP current at the time of this writing). 
                     For the Antelope PHP toolbox to work correctly, the include files 
                     specified by the PHP_INC macro must be consistent 
                     with the PHP executable specified by the 
                     PHP_EXECUTABLE macro. An example value for the 
                     PYTHONINCLUDE macro might be '/usr/include/php', although this 
                     of course depends on local system configuration.

        Detail        &Literal{
                        The XMOTIFINCLUDE macro specifies the location 
                        of the include files (header files) for the 
                        X/Motif graphics toolkit. The directory specified 
                        by this macro should contain a subdirectory called Xm/ 
                        which has the actual toolkit header files. This macro must 
                        be set to a value which is consistent with the location 
                        given in the XMOTIFLIB macro, i.e. the header files and the 
                        library files pointed to by these two macros must 
                        correspond to each other. An example value for XMOTIFINCLUDE
                        might be '/usr/openwin/include' on Solaris; sometimes 
                        '/usr/X11R6/include' on Linux; and perhaps '/sw/include' on 
                        Macintosh, if the 'Fink' distribution of X/Motif has been

                        The XMOTIFLIB macro specifies the location 
                        of the link libraries for the X/Motif graphics toolkit. 
                        This macro must be set to a value which is consistent with
                        the location given in the XMOTIFINCLUDE macro, i.e. the header

The package contents are actually a bit platform-specific, which is not 
yet accounted for. For example, dynamic libraries are named differently 
on Darwin than on Linux and Solaris. 

Inter-package conflicts and dependencies are not accounted for. 

The \fBlocalmake\fP.pf contents are highly detailed and contingent on insider 
knowledge of the piece of software being built. It is intended that these 
package descriptions be written by the author of the relevant piece 
of code. 

The \fBlocalmake\fP GUI will restart itself after compiling a module named
\fIbootstrap\fP. The \fIbootstrap\fP module allows the \fBlocalmake\fP
and \fBlocalmake_config\fP compilation facility easily updatable between 
official Antelope releases. 

\fBlocalmake\fP will sometimes report success in compilation even though it 
has failed somewhere along the line. This is due to an internal weakness in the 
way it spawns subsidiary make commands, a weakness which could be fixed but at a cost 
not yet allocated. Make sure to scan compilation output for evidence of errors (these 
should be fairly prominent in the colored-output when running \fBlocalmake\fP
as a GUI). 

Note that the \fIproduct\fP parameter does not control the actual compilation target of 
the files in a module. The \fIproduct\fP parameter is meant to describe the context in which the 
module belongs, to aid software packaging if the \fI-t\fP option is used, and, 
if \fIsrc_subdir\fP is a relative path, as an aid to finding the correct source-code files.
The actual install directory for the software is controlled by the Makefiles for the source-code. 

The array name for a given module must not contain the string \fIsrc_subdir\fP. All top-level parameters 
containing \fIsrc_subdir\fP in their parameter names are ignored, allowing sophisticated users to use 
several of them as parameter-file \fIbare references\fP (see pf(5)) when managing multiple repositories 
and source-code trees. 

The tarball creation code has not been tested after extensive changes, and may no longer work as 
advertised. 

If a module has elements with paths that start with \fInobuild/\fP, \fBlocalmake\fP will warn the 
user of potential conflicts with Antelope before installing.
