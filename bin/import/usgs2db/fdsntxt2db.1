.TH FDSNTXT2DB 1 
.SH NAME
fdsntxt2db \- utility to retrieve earthquake information in text format from \fBFDSN\fP services.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBfdsntxt2db\fP [-v] [-a \fIauthor\fP]
      [-k \fIkeydbname\fP] [-u \fIservice-url\fP] \fIdbname\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfdsntxt2db\fP  queries fdsn services for event information in text format
and stores the event information in a database.
The programs keeps track of event ids in a separate table and updates 
the output database if new information is available.
.br
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-v
verbose flag
.IP -h
Show help.
.IP "-k keydbname"
name of database to keep track of event ids. Since USGS/EMSC IDs 
are a mixture of strings and integers, a separate table is needed.
The database must be in schema \fBidmatch1.0\fP or higher. The database 
is created upon startup if not originally existing. 
The database name defaults to keydb.
.IP \-u
URL of the data source. A list of all available feeds can be found on a 
website of the \fBFDSN\fP: \fBhttps://www.fdsn.org/datacenters/\fP. 
Please be aware that not all datacenters provide event information. And 
not all datacenters providing event information also support the text format.
The URL defaults to \fBhttp://webservices.ingv.it/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=text\fI, 
the service run by INGV for Italy.
.IP "-a author"
Author name for event, origin and netmag table. If this is not specified, the author information returned by the service is used. There is no default.
.IP database
The name of the output database. This argument is required.
.SH EXAMPLE
To retrieve recent event data from INGV into a database named \fBingv\fP:
.nf
fdsntxt2db -k db/fdsn_ids -v ingv
.fi
To update event information every 10 minutes, add the following to your rtexec.pf
.nf
# update database USGS every 10 minutes, all events above magnitude 2.5
INGV   UTC   0,10,20,30,40,50   *  *  *  *  fdsntxt2db -k db/fdsn_ids db/ingv 
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The program uses the Python module \fIrequests\fP to retrieve data from a 
webservice. This module supports proxy configuration based on the standard 
environment variables \fIhttp_proxy\fP, \fIhttps_proxy\fP.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Since the text format for event information does not provide information on 
when the data has been updated, information on existing events is always 
overwritten. This is inefficient but unavoidable. The error handling is simple.
I implemented my personal understanding of the data offered. There might 
be wiser ways to use the save the information in a database. 
This module uses the python modules requests with all their bugs and 
limitations. And of course I added many more problems...
