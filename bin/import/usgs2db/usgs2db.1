.SH DESCRIPTION
.I usgs2db and emsc2db read feeds in GeoJSON format and stores the event information in a database.
The programs keeps track of event ids in a separate table and updates the output database if new information is available.
.br
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-v
verbose flag
.IP "-k keydbname"
name of database to keep track of event ids. Since USGS/EMSC IDs are a mixture of strings and integers, a separate table is needed.
The database must be in schema \fBidmatch1.0\fP or higher. The database is created upon startup if not originally existing. The database name defaults to keydb.
.IP \-u
URL of the data source. A list of all available feeds can be found on a website of the \fIUSGS\fP
\fBhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php\fP
If not specified, this defaults to 
\fBhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_hour.geojson\fP.
For \fIEMSC\fP, the program retrieves data from the FDSN webservice described on 
\fBhttp://www.seismicportal.eu/fdsn-wsevent.html\fP
the default url in this case is
\fBhttp://www.seismicportal.eu/fdsnws/event/1/query?limit=10&format=json\fP.
.IP "-a author"
Author name for event, origin and netmag table. Defaults to NEIC or EMSC
.IP database
The name of the output database. This argument is required.
.SH EXAMPLE
To retrieve all event data for the last month into a database named \fBusgs\fP:
.nf
usgs2db -k db/usgs_ids -v -u http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson usgs
.fi
To update event information every 10 minutes, add the following to your rtexec.pf
.nf
# update database USGS every 10 minutes, all events above magnitude 2.5
USGS   UTC   0,10,20,30,40,50   *  *  *  *  usgs2db -k db/usgs_ids db/usgs 

.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The program uses the Python module \fIrequests\fP to retrieve data from a webpage.
This module supports proxy configuration based on the standard environment variables \fIhttp_proxy\fP, \fIhttps_proxy\fP. 
If you need more control over proxy settings, feel free to contact the author, Nikolaus.Horn@zamg.ac.at.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The error handling is simple. I implemented my personal understanding of the data offered. There might be wiser ways to use the save the information in a database.
The feeds are subject to the feed life cycle policy as explained on the website of the usgs. See there for more information if a feed stops working.
This module uses the python modules requests with all their bugs and limitations. And of course I added many more problems...
