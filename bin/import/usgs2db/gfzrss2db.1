.TH GFZRSS2DB 1 
.SH NAME
gfzrss2db \- utility to retrieve earthquake information in text format from \fBFDSN\fP services.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBgfzrss2db\fP [-v] [-a \fIauthor\fP]
      [-k \fIkeydbname\fP] [-u \fIservice-url\fP] \fIdbname\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgfzrss2db\fP queries the RSS-Feed of GPZ
and stores the event information in a database.
The programs keeps track of event ids in a separate table and updates 
the output database if new information is available.
.br
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-v
verbose flag
.IP -h
Show help.
.IP "-k keydbname"
name of database to keep track of event ids. Since IDs used by GFZ 
are a mixture of strings and integers, a separate table is needed.
The database must be in schema \fBidmatch1.0\fP or higher. The database 
is created upon startup if not originally existing. 
The database name defaults to keydb.
.IP \-u
URL of the data source. The RSS-Feed should have exact the same format as 
provided by GFZ on http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/eqinfo/list.php?fmt=rss.
Probably it makes no sense not to use the default given above.
.IP "-a author"
Author name for event, origin and netmag table. The event flag (A for automatic) is appended. Defaults to GFZ.
.IP database
The name of the output database. This argument is required.
.SH EXAMPLE
Recent event data from GFZ into a database named \fBgfz\fP:
.nf
gfzrss2db -k db/gfz_ids -v gfz
.fi
To update event information every 10 minutes, add the following to your rtexec.pf
.nf
# update database gfz every 10 minutes
GFZ   UTC   0,10,20,30,40,50   *  *  *  *  gfzrss2db -k db/gfz_ids db/gfz 
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The program uses the Python module \fIrequests\fP to retrieve data from a 
webservice. This module supports proxy configuration based on the standard 
environment variables \fIhttp_proxy\fP, \fIhttps_proxy\fP. 
If you need more control over proxy settings, feel free to 
contact the author, Nikolaus.Horn@zamg.ac.at.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Since the text format for event information does not provide information on 
when the data has been updated, information on existing events is always 
overwritten. This is inefficient, but unavoidable. The error handling is simple.
Since no magnitude type is given, it is set to \fImb\fP.
I implemented my personal understanding of the data offered. There might 
be wiser ways to use the save the information in a database. 
This module uses the python modules requests with all their bugs and 
limitations. And of course I added many more problems...
