.SH NAME
mail_parser\- direct incoming emails to customized perl handlers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mail_parser [-v] [-m] [-f logfile] [-l library_path]
		[-p pffile] [file [file...]]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Often it is convenient to have a variety of automatic email information and 
request messages come into a single address for reformatting (info intake) 
and data-distribution (info requests). 

N.B. DISCLAIMER: All mail handling utilities in the Antelope contributed-code repository are provided as-is, with no guarantee either express or implied that they will function as desired, as described, or as expected. All risk of loss or difficulty of any sort from running these utilites is assumed solely by the end user. 

mail_parser takes a mail file composed of one or more messages, parses the 
input into component messages, and searches its parameter file for perl-script
handlers that apply to the given sender and subject. If no handler is found,
the message is ignored. Otherwise the message is handed to the first handler
that applies and the rest of the handlers are skipped for that message. The
mail_parser parameter file specifies perl regular expressions which the
email sender and subject must match in order for the handler to be used on it. 

If no filename or filenames are specified on the command line, mail_parser
expects to receive input from standard-in. 

When multiple mail-messages are stored in files, embedded lines in each 
message that start with "From " are escaped with a '>' character. When 
mail messages are delivered into a .forward file, these escape-characters 
are removed. Therefore mail-parser requires a command-line switch to 
toggle between two different modes. The '-m' switch allows the input 
to be parsed into multiple messages if multiple messages are present. This 
mode assumes that embedded From lines are properly escaped. The -m option
is recommended when reading from a file. In the mode without -m, mail_parser
assumes that only one message is being fed to it. Embedded From lines 
are ignored. This mode (without -m) is recommended when mail_parser is 
being fed directly from a mail utility, for example via a .forward file.

The parameter file entries for individual handlers may contain parameters 
specific to each handler, in addition to the required sender and subject 
regular expressions. 

If a mail message is found for which a given handler applies, mail_parser loads
the handler and runs it. This is most easily shown with an example. If a mail
message comes in for which the "submit_pepp" handler applies, mail_parser first
attempts to load submit_pepp.pl with the perl "require" command.  After doing
this, mail_parser expects it will have available to it the perl subroutine
submit_pepp_handler(). This subroutine should take two arguments:  the first is
an object reference to a Perl Mail::Internet object. The second is a Perl
reference to a hash. This hash contains the associative-array entries for the
submit_pepp handler from the mail_parser.pf parameter file.

Installing mail_parser to handle mail for a given email account usually
requires the mail_parser_wrapper(1) script also, which is documented
separately. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v"
verbose output
.IP "-l \fIlib_dir\fR"
Specify library directory with *.pl files containing handlers. 
Note that if handlers are contained in the standard $(ANTELOPE)/data/perl
directory this should not be necessary. 
.IP "-p \fIpffile\fR" 
Specify the parameter file. Default is mail_parser.pf
.IP "-f \fIlogfile\fR"
Specify a file for log messages and program output
.IP "-m"
Enable splitting of the input file(s) into multiple mail messages
.SH FILES
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The mail_parser parameter file contains an ordered table of associative 
arrays. Each handler will have an associative array containing at least 
three key-value pairs: one for subject, one for sender, and one for handler 
name. The first two are Perl regular-expressions specifying the mail-messages
for which the handler should be applied. The third is the name of the handler 
itself. Handlers will be tested against incoming mail messages in the order
in which the handlers appear in this table. The example shown here is 
for the submit_pepp handler. For further details on this handler, please 
see the submit_pepp(3) man page.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
mail_parser was originally written with Perl taint-checking turned on. Because 
some of the handlers commit tasks (file writing etc.) that do not 
pass Perl taint-checking, taint-checking has been turned off in the mail_parser
script. However it is good to keep security in mind when writing individual
handlers. If handler content permits it, the operator may want to turn 
taint-checking back on.

parameters passed to individual handlers via the mail_parser.pf parameter 
file will be affected by the standard parameter-file parsing. For 
example, characters such as the pound character must be escaped with a
backslash.

sendmail security may affect the installation of this command to automatically
process incoming mail. For details, see your system administrator.

mail_parser is written so that if something goes wrong, it will report the error
but still die with exit status of zero. This prevents mail_parser problems 
from causing the input email to bounce back to the sender, i.e. automatically
airing dirty laundry in public. The price of this feature is that any eval 
commands in handlers must be replaced by calls to myeval(), or alternatively 
the author needs more hints about perl. 

Two options would be nice to have: logging of incoming email messages, and 
an option to specify forwarding addresses in the mail_parser parameter file. 
The former at least is straightforward. Both of these goals may be accomplished
through appropriate setup of the .forward file. The advantage of parameter-file
specification of forwarding addresses is that the choice of forwarding 
recipients could be tailored to the filtering on sender/subject. Initial 
experiments with the Mail::Internet->smtpsend() were left aside in the 
interests of getting real work done.
