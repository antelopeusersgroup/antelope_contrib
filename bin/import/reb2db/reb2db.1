.SH NAME
reb2db \- reformat Reviewed Event Bulletins to CSS3.1 or optionally CSS3.0 database format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
reb2db [-dv] [-0] filename [filename ...] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
reb2db converts Reviewed Event Bulletin files from the International
Data Centre of the Center for Monitoring Research (www.cdidc.org)
into css database format. Acceptable input formats include GSE2.0, 
IMS1.0, IMS1.0:SHORT, IMS2.0, and IMS2.0:SHORT. 
Raw mail files with REB information may be fed to reb2db.
Note that for recent data from CTBT, the  \fIcss3.1\fP schema is required since the ids 
became too large for the original \fIcss3.0\fP schema.

The algorithm field of the origin table abbreviates the analysis 
type ("auto"=automatic, "man"=manual, "guess") and the location 
method ("inversion", "patnrec"=pattern recognition, "grndtruth"=ground truth,
"other").
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose flag
.IP -d
Write detections when the input is arrivals
.IP -0
create new database using css3.0 schema. Default is to use css3.1 since CTBT uses longer ids now.

Not in IMS1.0, IMS1.0:SHORT, IMS2.0, IMS2.0:SHORT or GSE2.0 format

No DATA_TYPE line--assume IMS1.0 format
(reb2db expects to find either 
DATA_TYPE BULLETIN GSE2.0
or
DATA_TYPE BULLETIN IMS1.0
or
DATA_TYPE BULLETIN IMS1.0:SHORT
in the file)

Warning: problem adding phase:
 ***: Couldn't add a new record to table slop.arrival
	The new record matched the primary key of record #8, but field 'arid' is different.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If no DATA_TYPE line is found, reb2db assumes IMS1.0 format at the 
first instance that it hits an EVENT line. reb2db is a state-machine
that reads input lines successively from all supplied input files. If a 
file after the first file does not have an explicitly specified DATA_TYPE, 
the format (IMS1.0, IMS1.0:SHORT, IMS2.0, IMS2.0:SHORT or GSE2.0) will 
carry over from the previous file. 

The seaz field of the assoc table is not filled in since it does not appear
in the IMS1.0 format and since there is no guarantee of the presence 
of a site table. In principle seaz could be derived from the event location 
plus delta and esaz fields, but this has not been done. 

The specification of a pick as automatic shows up by appending the string 
":auto" to the author name of the arrival. 

There are several instances in REB catalogs where the same phase appears twice,
either multiple times for the same earthquake or in a couple different 
earthquakes (sometimes one of the two has incomplete association information 
in it, or no magnitudes, or the arids will be different, or one will be 
manual and one automatic). Clearly these are catalog problems. However, a 'first come, 
first served' approach of saving the first one reb2db finds 
and discarding the second one may not be appropriate: maybe the second 
occurrence is the one that should be kept. Because of database-addition rules, 
however, in general adding two phases with matching primary keys causes 
an unacceptable error that leads to program death. The solution implemented 
in reb2db is to issue a warning upon the repeated occurrence of a phase 
arrival, then force its addition to the database. Thus the database produced 
by reb2db is an accurate reflection of what is in the REB input file, including 
the mistakes. 
Since the arrival ids used within the CTBT IDC, using the css3.1 format is mandatory 
to convert the data while keeping the ids.
