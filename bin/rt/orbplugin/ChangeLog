2015.187:
	- Incorportate minor changes from Niko Horn (ZAMG) for 64-bit
	compatibility with Antelope 5.0+.
	- Remove cflags=-O from Makefile and this does not appear to be
	supported syntax for the build system any longer.

2004.355:
	- Add channel start time to verbose channel message.
	- Add diagnostics messages for ORB position resurrection and
	initialization.
	
2004.316:
	- Set the msd->hook pointer to 0 (was chandata) before calling
	msdfree() when resetting a data stream.  This should keep
	free_hook() from being called, which wouldn't work with our
	pointer anyway.

2004.237:
	- Update to work with multiplexed ORB packets (more than one
	channel per packet).
	- The creation of 1001 blockettes for QCDAT ORB packets now	
	includes a blockette header that is always big-endian.
	- Include a more efficient find_reclen() routine to verify SEED
	and return record length.
	- Update to the newer Antelope msd_* family of library interfaces.
	- Remove the old comserv headers that were not needed.

2004.018:
	- Update the plugin.c and plugin.h files from the current
	  SeisComP-2.0 distribution.
	- Add functionality to detect when the incoming ORB packets have
	  512-byte miniSEED records in them and pass them directly
	  (without repackaging) to the controlling SeedLink server.  This
	  behavior can be turned off with the new -p' option, causing all
	  data to be (re)packed into 512-byte miniSEED records regardless
	  of their original type.

2002.254:
	- Updated some pointer assignments to get rid of compiler warnings
	  with GCC.  Basic testing under a Linux environment, everything
	  seems to work fine.

	- Renamed the Makefile.sun to Makefile as it will work fine under
	  Solaris or Linux as long as the ANTELOPEMAKE env. var. is set
	  correctly.  A Makefile.sungcc is still included for people using
	  GCC under Solaris.
	
2002.154:
	- Changed the reference to 'private' member in Steim structures.
	  This was renamed from 'private' to 'pvt' starting with
	  Antelope 4.4.
	- Added an '-o' flag for the ORB location instead of assuming
	  it is the last argument.  Better behavior for a SL plugin.

2002.030:
	- Added an '-r' flag for a packet rejection specification
	
2001.353:
	- Changed orbreap_nd() call to orbreap() and all the other things
	  needed to make the module data driven.
	- Changed the statefile saving interval to number of packets
	  received instead of elapsed seconds.  This makes more sense when
	  using the blocking call to orbreap().
	- Fixed the statefile string parsing.
	- Added a Makefile.gcc for compiling with GNU's gcc and updated
	  the README file build instructions.
	
2001.261:
	- Removed the code creating 100 blockettes (actual sample rate).
	  Records now have a 64 byte header and 7 frames of data.
	- Added ability to generate a 1001 blockette (timing quality)
	  when the original packet is of type QCDAT (Quanterra data as
	  collected by qt2orb).  The timing quality is calculated
	  in the same way as done by Comserv.  *caveats* read 'README'
	
2001.???:
	- Changed the poll interval to 50000 usec instead of 100000.
	- Used orbresurrect rather than a regular resurrect.

Before:
	- Added a feature to trim partially overlapping data.
	- Added state (ORB position) saving functionality.
