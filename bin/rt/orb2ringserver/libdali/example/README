directory.

-- daliclient.c --

An example DataLink client written in C that demonstrates general
usage of libdali.  A Makefile is provided to build the client.  The
client does not exercise all of the functionality of libdali.  For a
more comprehensive example the developer is referred to the source
code for dalitool.

Solaris: to compile daliclient.c the Makefile needs to be edited 
(comments are included in the Makefile).

Windows: to compile daliclient.c use the Nmake compatible Makefile.win
(e.g. >nmake -f Makefile.win) or Watcom's Wmake with Makefile.wat
(e.g. >wmake -f Makefile.wat). 


-- streamlist.conf --

An example stream list that can be used with the -m or -r arguments
of daliclient or with the dl_read_streamlist() function from libdali.
