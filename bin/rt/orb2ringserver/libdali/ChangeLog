	- dl_position(): return 0 when packet was not found.  Differentiates
	between successful request (but no match) and function error.
	Previously this function returned either a positive packet ID value
	or -1, where -1 was returned when packet was not found.
	Fixes from Doug Neuhauser:
	- dl_position(): allow specification of LIBDALI_POSITION_EARLIEST and
	LIBDALI_POSITION_LATEST in parameter sanity check.  Oops.
	- dl_disconnect(): continue shutdown when socket value is 0.

	- Add '_ld' suffix to declaration of pivotal_gmtime_r_stamp in
	timeutils.c to avoid conflicts with other libraries.  Thanks to Doug
	Neuhauser for the tip.

2011.004: 1.4
	- Correct return code for dl_position() for errors.
	- Increase verbosity level for debugging message in dl_write().

2011.003: 1.3
	- Add support to dl_position() to set read position to earliest
	or latest packet, thanks to Doug Neuhauser for the patch.
	- Updates in connection.c from Doug Neuhauser for invalid socket
	descriptor handling.
	- Add internal dl_gmtime_r() to avoid the not thread-safe call to
	the system gmtime().  The internal version handles dates beyond year
	2038 and is 64-bit friendly.
	- Rework/casting of printing/scanning for clean 64-bit build.

2008.284: 1.2
	- Change dl_write() to return an error -1 when the server
	acknowledgement indicates there was an error.  Also print the
	server replies indicating errors at a lower verbosity level than
	acknowledgements indicating success.

2008.256: 1.1
	- DataLink protocol addition of packet end time changes, this
	modified the WRITE command and PACKET response to include
	both the packt data start and end times. 
	
2008.196: 1.0
	- Do not fail if setsockopt() failed to set socket timeouts.

2008.193: 0.9.7
	- Modify behavior of dl_read() to consume data from a packet
	that is too large for the supplied buffer.
	- Generalize the names of the arguments to dl_splitstreamid().
	- Parse PACKETSIZE capabilities flag from server, store in
	new DLCP.maxpktsize and check size in dl_write().
	- Add documentation tagging for Doxygen to all sources.

2008.173: 0.9.6
	- Add DLCP.writeperm flag and set to true if the server
	returns the write permission flag in it's capabilities
	string.

2008.169: 0.9.5
	- Add DLCP.iotimeout parameter and set the socket timeout
	options (SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO) if they exist on the
	system, otherwise use an alarm timer to interrupt send/recv
	calls.  These measures should reset connections in bad network
	environments.  Timeout defaults to 60 seconds.

2008.078:
	- Use io.h header instead of unistd.h for Win32.

2008.075: 0.9.4
	- Replace redundant error message for unsuccessful sending of
	WRITE commands with a check for reply from server in
	dl_sendpacket().
	- Remove const qualifier from user-supplied logging functions. 
	- Fix dlp_genclientid() and defines for Win32.

2008.074: 0.9.3
	- Update dlp_genclientid() to lookup the current user without
	needing an interactive shell login.
	- Fix dl_freedlcp(), address and client ID strings are now static.

2008.072: 0.9.2
	- Implement dlp_genclientid() routine to generate client IDs.
	- Change dl_newdlcp() to take address and progname arguments,
	these strings will be copied and stored in the DLCP struct
	and freed with dl_freedlcp().  dl_newdlcp() now sets the client
	ID using dlp_genclientid().
	- Change portable define DLP_DARWIN to DLP_BSD to cover all BSDs.

2008.070: 0.9.1
	- Add an infomatch argument to dl_getinfo() and add the match
	expression to the INFO request.  Allows limiting a request for
	CONNECTIONS to specific clients.

2008.060:
	- Change dl_getinfo() to take a pointer-to-a-pointer for the
	info buffer and allocate an appropriate size buffer when
	the maxinfosize argument is 0.

2008.057: 0.9
	- Initial version, derived from libslink 2.0.
