2023.022: 1.7
	- Improve deliniation of diagnostic versus error messages
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.8

2020.134: 1.6
	- Incorporate changes from Doug Neuhauser, including these features:
	  # Add -F option to control flushing of data based on channel rate
	    and duration.
	  # Add -l option to specify miniSEED record length to create.
	  # Avoid holding time-torn data in internal buffers, and instead
	    flush the previous data when a time tear is detected.
	- New default 32-bit miniSEED encoding is dyanmic: first try Steim-2,
	then Steim-1, and finally use uncompressed integers.
	- Add -I option to strictly specify encoding of 32-bit integers.
	- Fix flushing based on latency to proper channels only.
	- Update libdali to 1.8, with support for IPv6, etc.
	- Update libmseed to 2.19.6.

2016.295: 1.5
	- Update libmseed to 2.18.
	- Update libdali to 1.7.

2015.042: 1.4
	- Adjust log level on multiple messages to avoid *complain* Antelope
	logging for diagnostic messages.
	- Change "Flushing data buffer..." message to require verbosity.

2014.273: 1.3
	- Include Blockette 1001 in generated miniSEED.

2014.261: 1.2
	- Update libmseed to 2.13.
	- Apply simple rounding to Antelope data packet start time when
	converting to an hptime_t value.

2014.028: 1.1
	- Remove setting of unneeded Program_Name global variable to avoid
	crash bug in Antelope 5.3.

2013.280: 1.0
	- Update libdali to 1.6.
	- Update libmseed to 2.12.
	- Add code to maintain the time base of internal data buffers according
	to the start time of received packets.  This avoids accumulating 
	timing imperfections of the incoming data and means any significant
	timing imperfections are more accuratley represented by the output
	stream.

2013.117: 0.4
	- Update libmseed to 2.11 to fix issues with uninitialized variable
	usage during error conditions.

2013.085: 0.3
	- Remove segment buffers that contain no samples to avoid retaining
	many empty entries after many time tears in data.

2013.010: 0.2
	- Fix memory leak of MSRecord in handlestream(), thanks to
	David Chavez for discovery.

2012.320: 0.1+
	- Fix usage overview and clarify -f argument in man page.
	- Fix embedded usage message.

2012.270: 0.1
	- Initial version.
