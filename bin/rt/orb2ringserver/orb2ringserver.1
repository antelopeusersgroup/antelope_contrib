.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorb2ringserver\fP collects selected time series packets from an
orbserver(1), converts the data to 512-byte miniSEED records and
transmits the records to a ringserver (via DataLink).  If the orb
packet already contains a 512-byte miniSEED record it is forwarded
as-is.  The ringserver program is commonly configured to serve the
data via the SeedLink protocol.

Due to the differences between ORB packet lengths and miniSEED
records, the program maintains a small internal buffer for each time
series.  This allows the program to create full and efficient miniSEED
records, but also introduces a slight delay or latency in the data
transmission.  The amount of delay depends on the sample rate of the
data and the compressability of the series, for most purposes it is
inconsequential.  If the original packet from the ORB is already a
512-byte miniSEED record no delay is incurred.

The orbserver and ringserver are specified as \fIhost\fP:\fIport\fP.
Both host and port may be empty (blank), in which case \fIhost\fP
defaults to \fBlocalhost\fP, and port defaults to \fB6510\fP (for the
orbserver) or \fB16000\fP (for the ringserver).  The orbserver port
may be either an explicit number, or an alphanumeric name which is
looked up in the file \fI$ANTELOPE/data/pf/orbserver_names.pf\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-v      "
Increase the verbosity, this flag may be specified multiple times.

.IP "-f latency"
Flush data from internal buffers when no new packets have arrived for
\fIlatency\fP seconds, default is 500 seconds.  The latency check is
applied to each channel/stream individually.  This flushing mechanism
ensures that data do not remain in the buffers when the channel has
stopped flowing.  The mechanism can be disabled by specifying a value
of 0.

.IP "-F rate[@duration]"
Perform a fast flush from internal buffers for data channels where
\fIrate\fP (specified in samples per second) is >= data sampling rate.
If a \fIduration\fP (in seconds) is specified the fast flush will
occur when at least that duration of data has been accumulated.  This
option will almost certainly result in the creation of unfilled data
records, but allows controlling latency of data streams added by this
program.  The mechanism is turned off by default (a value of zero).

.IP "-l reclen"
Specify the miniSEED record length to create, with a default of 512
bytes.  Other common options are 256 or 128 for reduced latency.
Note that this option does not effect data that are already miniSEED
records, which are forwarded directly.

.IP "-I [21I]"
Specify the miniSEED encoding to use for 32-bit integers.  A value
of \fI2\fP means Steim-2 compression, \fI1\fP means Steim-1 compression,
and \fII\fP means uncompressed integers.  The default encoding
for 32-bit integers is to first try Steim-2, then Steim-1 and finally
use uncompressed.

.IP "-R interval"
If the connection to the destination ringserver is broken attempt to
reconnect at \fIinterval\fP in seconds, default is 60 seconds.  If the
interval is 0 no reconnections are attempted and the program will exit
if the connection is broken.

.IP "-m match"
.IP "-r reject"
Copy only packets which \fImatch\fP the regular expression \fImatch\fP
and do not \fImatch\fP the regular expression \fIreject\fP.

.IP "-s pktid|time"
Start after the particular \fIpktid\fP or \fItime\fP.  Normally the
input is positioned to the most recent packet on the orbserver or
positioned based on a state file, and packets after that packet are
received.  If a \fIpktid\fP or \fItime\fP is specified, and \fIno
pre-existing state file is used for positioning\fP, the input is
positioned to the first packet after the specified packet ID or time,
and packets after that time are received.  The \fItime\fP may be
specified in a wide variety of formats understood by str2epoch(3) or
epoch(1).  If the format includes spaces, you must enclose the time
\fIin\fP quotes.  If the option is all digits it is assumed to be a
packet ID, otherwise a time.

.IP "-S statefile[:pkts]"
If the -S option is specified the time and \fIpktid\fP of the last
packet received are saved to the \fIstatefile\fP file whenever the
program is terminated.  When the program is restarted, (if the -S
option is specified), this file will be read and used to resume the
connection such that there are no gaps.  If a \fIpkts\fP integer is
specified, the \fIstatefile\fP will be written every number of
\fIpkts\fP processes to mitigate issues related to unexpected crashes.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
%\fB orb2orb -m 'IU.*' -S state/orb2ringserver -v localhost:6510 localhost:16000\fP
orb2ringserver: orb2ringserver version: 1.0
orb2ringserver: Connected to orbserver at localhost:6510
orb2ringserver: Resuming ORB position from state file
orb2ringserver: Connected to ringserver at localhost:16000

.SH "USAGE"
This program generates 512-byte miniSEED records by default with
the expectation that the destination ringserver can easily be
configured to serve data via the SeedLink protocol.  The ringserver nor
the DataLink protocol are limited to miniSEED or 512-bytes, but
this is expected to be the most common use for this software.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The internal buffering of time series data can add latency to the data
streams.  The amount of latency added depends on the sample rate and
compression of the time series.  For relatively high rate data (>20
sps) the amount of latency added is quite small for most purposes.

Normally when a termination signal is received the program will flush
it's internal buffers and send all remaining data to the destination
ringserver.  This process will likely create "unfilled" miniSEED
records, this is a very minor issue in most cases.

If a termination signal is received while the connection to the
destination ringserver is broken the probgram will exit without
flusing it's internal buffer.  Additionally, the read position of the
orbserver is saved as the last orb packet received, which is not
necessarily related to the last data transmitted to the ringsever.  In
short, this scenario will likely generate a gap in all time series.
