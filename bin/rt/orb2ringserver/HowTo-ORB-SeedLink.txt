This is a description of how to set up a SeedLink data exchange server
for data in an Antelope ORB using the ringserver and orb2ringserver
programs.

These instructions are written with the assumption that the ringserver
and orb2ringserver binaries will be managed using Antelope's rtm
framework commonly used to managed other processes in an Antelope
real-time system.

1. Build latest ringserver program, source code available here:
https://github.com/iris-edu/ringserver

2. Build latest orb2ringserver program, source code available here:
https://github.com/iris-edu/orb2ringserver

3. Create a directory for the ringserver to store it's buffers:

$ mkdir ring

4. Add ringserver and orb2ringserver commands to rtexec.pf:

ringserver      ringserver -Rd ring -Rs 1G -DL 16000 -SL 18000 -I "XX Seismic Network" 
orb2ringserver  orb2ringserver -m '.*BHZ.*' localhost:6510 localhost:16000

These options will configure the ringserver with a 1 gigabyte buffer
size (equivalent RAM is used) and transfer all BHZ channels from a
local ORB to the ringserver. The -I option configures the ringserver
(SeedLink server) identifier and should be changed to identify your
organization.

5. Enable the ringserver and orb2ringserver processes in the rtexec.pf
file either by adding entries to the Run Array or by toggling them in
the GUI.

More options are available for the ringserver, such as enabling
shipment logging of all SeedLink connections, changing buffer sizes,
limited access via IP addresses, etc. See the ringserver(1) man page
for full details.

Likewise, more options are available for orb2ringserver, see the
orb2ringserver(1) man page for full details.
