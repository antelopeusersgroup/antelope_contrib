6 July 2015
  - Update to libslink to 2.4b.
  - Small fix to logging shim functions to avoid compiler warnings.
  - version 4.2.

31 August 2012
  - Update to allow more packet types to be forwared to the orb, for
      example state-of-health channels should now work.
  - Cleanup some compiler warnings, fix a teeny-tiny print bug.
  - version 4.1.

5 March 2008
  - Update to libslink 2.1 which includes the ability to use wildcards
      in network and station fields during negotiation.
  - Change mseed2orbpkt() to only invoke a mapping database call if a
      mapping database was specified, eliminating stray foreignkeys dbs.
  - version 4.0

2 Mar 2006
  - Make 'slink2orb.pf' the default parameter file.

27 Jan 2006
  - Update to libslink 1.6, no changes to library or module.

8 Dec 2005
  - Update to libslink 1.6rc1 including many updates: error messages
      go to stderr, sl_connect does it's own parsing of the sladdr
      string and fills in default hostname and port when needed, and
      many small bug fixes.
  - Remove checking of sladdr from slink2orb.c, it's done in libslink.
  - Remove unused variables and other small fixes.
  - Add version number to help message.

18 Jun 2004
  - Update to libslink 1.2a with a fix for compiling using a compiler
      that does not assume *void == *char for pointer arithmetic, i.e.
      a Sun compiler.

17 Jun 2004
  - Update to libslink 1.2 including more flexible support for
      implementations of the SeedLink protocol other than the
      reference implementation by Andres Heinloo. 
  - version 3.4

25 Feb 2004
  - Split the '-d' option into two options '-dm' and '-dc' to 
      specify databases for mapping and calib, etc. separately.
  - Significant cleanup/update to the mseed2orbpkt.c code, now
      it's much more simple.
  - version 3.3
	
21 Jan 2004
  - Add hook functions to re-direct sl_log() usage to elog_notify()
      and elog_complain().
  - version 3.2

20 Jan 2004
  - Include libslink 1.0 and recode to use it.
  - Remove slinkutils.{c|h} as it is replaced by libslink.
  - Remove the dumpfile option, there are other tools for this.
	
16 Jan 2003
  - Remove the need for a C++ compiler on little-endian architectures by
      removing the need for big-endian.h and byteorder_swap.h by
      doing the small amount of byte swapping needed with ntohs() in
      sl_blocktype().  Sure helps with portability.
  - version 3.0
	
14 Jan 2003
  - Rewrite the main loop code (heart transplant).
  - Added keepalive capability, can specify interval on command line 
      or in the parameter file.  This includes the logic to send INFO
      requests and received them.  There is no capability to
      actually parse the returned XML.
  - Included an updated version of the SeedLink connection routines
      (slinkutils.x).  This includes the ability to detect the
      remote server version number and check it before using
      features that only exist in more recent server versions,
      i.e. multistation, keepalives, etc.

29 Nov 2002
  - Update mseed2orbpkt.c to give more room to 'segtype'.  Fixes a
      bug when calling dbget_calib().  Thanks to Nikolaus Horn!
  - version 2.2c
	
1 Nov 2002
  - Added some clearer error messages to mseed2orbpkt.c when there
      are problems mapping the channel name with the snetsta and
      schanloc tables.
  - Removed all references to keepalive/heartbeats, it will never
      exist in the 2.x version level.
  - version 2.2b

9 May 2002
  - Added some logic to fail during link configuration if either no
      given selectors or no given stations (multi-station mode only)
      were accepted.  This should avoid confusion for users that 
      receive unexpected data because their specified selectors or
      stations were not accepted by the server.  Note: selectors,
      unlike stations, will only fail if they are malformed;
      acceptance does not mean that data fitting that selector mask
      is available.
  - version 2.2a

10 April 2002
  - Re-worked the timing logic in the main loop for the network delay,
      timeout and state file saving so it is easier to read/modify later.
  - version 2.2, ready for production use.

4 April 2002
  - Add some code to select() for readability of the network socket while
      in the main read loop.  Subsequently remove the call to usleep() in
      the main read loop as select() now does the waiting for us.  The
      'polltime' parameter in the pf has been replaced with
      'selectwaittime', and should never need to be changed.
    This *significantly* increases the data transport rate, which is most
      obvious when "recovering" from an outage.  This also makes
      slink2orb scale much better when collecting many data streams
      using multi-station mode/protocol.  Yipee!
  - Open DB as read/write (r+) so that things like snetsta and schanloc
      tables can be updated.
	
11 Jan 2002
  - Update the man page
  - version 2.1, ready for production use.

3 Jan 2002
  - Fixed some nasty memory leaks
  - Reduced size of incoming packet buffer (enough for 4 SeedLink packets)
  - Move UNSEEDmod() routine into mseed2orbpkt.c source file and
      some do minor code cleanups in there

14 Dec 2001
  - Update the man page
  - version 2.0

13 Dec 2001
  - Fix bug in mseed2orbpkt.c, calib and calper were not correcly set!
  - Some minor code cleanups, i.e. only try to open state file if a
      state file was given on the command line, duh.

12 Dec 2001 10:00
  - Improved error messages so that a given slink2orb process can be
      identified; fully appreciated when running multiple clients at the
      same time
  - Restructuring of code to "improve" clarity (slinkutils.c)
  - If the SeedLink server address is given as ':port', i.e. omitting
      the host, then 'localhost' is inserted
	
19 Oct 2001 13:00
  - Add structures to define a connection and station description
      struct SLconnection & SLstation
  - Add a sl_configlink_multi() function to do multi-station config
      (SeedLink Protocol version 3) based on the new structures
  - Changed sl_configlink (uni-station config) to use the new structures
  - Changed the main code in slink2orb.c to fill/use the new structs
  - Removed the sequence gap detection snippet.  It's only useful if
      no selectors are used, just not worth it at the moment; a gap
      detector should work on stream time basis anyway.

2  Aug 2001 15:32
  - Add the '-o' flag to indicate a dumpfile to which all the Mini-SEED
      records will be appended, in addition to sending to the ORB
  - version 1.0-beta7

6  June 2001 15:00
  - sl_diconnect(): only shutdown() if connected (i.e. if slchecksock() > 1)

25 May 2001 14:00
  - Don't attempt to close socket on exit if it is not open.
  - Added a recv(...MSG_PEEK) check to sl_checksock()
  - Combine variables 'path' & 'newlink' into 'srvlink' for clarity.
  - version 1.0BETA-5

23 May 2001  9:00
  - Don't destroy existing file descriptor flags when setting O_NONBLOCK
  - Add sl_checksock() for checking the status of a socket connection
  - Re-fit sl_log() for generalized logging/printing of messages and
      use this for errors/messages in all of the SeedLink functions
  - version 1.0BETA-4

22 May 2001 15:00
  - Fix loop control to properly reset the connection and drop any
      unprocessed data when bad packets are detected
  - Add more diagnostic error messages to the packet processing and
      forwarding code
  - Various small fixes
  - version 1.0BETA-3

21 May 2001 14:00
  - Cleanups in sl_configlink() function, now uses it's own buffer
      (readbuf[]) for read()ing server responses.
  - More modularization of SeedLink functions
  - version 1.0BETA-2

18 May 2001  9:00
  - Add a close() to sl_connect() for connections that only made it
      "half way".  Should solve most of the multiple connect problems.

17 May 2001 13:00
  - rewrite the SeedLink client functions so they are more modular,
      i.e. not using global variables, more needs to be done.
  - Change names of SeedLink functions in (seedlink.c) for clarity
  - version 1.0BETA-1
  
10 May 2001 14:00
  - Put together the first Beta package, version 1.0BETA-0
