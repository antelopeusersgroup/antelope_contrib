.SH NAME
slink2orb \- SeedLink to Antelope ORB module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
slink2orb [-dc database] [-dm database] [-nd delay]
          [-nt timeout] [-k interval] [-pf parameter_file]
          [-S statefile] [-r] [-v] SeedLink ORB
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBslink2orb\fP connects to a \fISeedLink\fR server, requests data streams
and forwards received packets to an \fIORB\fR orbserver.

This client supports both SeedLink v3 and v4 protocols.  All miniSEED
version 2 records are forwarded directly to the ORB as packet type 'SEED'.
Any miniSEED version 3 records are converted to 'GENC' packet types
(SeedLink v4 protocol only).

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-dm \fIdatabase\fR"
Use the specified database for mapping FDSN codes to CSS database
names.  If the channel names do not exist in the specified database
they will be inserted.  If this database is not specified the local
foreignkeys database will be used.

.IP "-dc \fIdatabase\fR"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database.  Recommended if the data will be processed
directly from the ORB since this information is not available
in the data stream.

.IP "-nd \fIdelay\fR"
The network reconnect delay (in seconds) for the connection to
the SeedLink server.  If the connection breaks for any reason
this will govern how soon a reconnection should be attempted.
The default value is 30 seconds.

.IP "-nt \fItimeout\fR"
The network timeout (in seconds) for the connection to the SeedLink
server.  If no data are received in this time the connection is closed
and re-established (after the reconnect delay has expired).  The default
value is 600 seconds. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

.IP "-k \fIinterval\fR"
Keepalive packet interval (in seconds) at which keepalive (heartbeat)
packets are sent to the server.  Keepalive packets are only sent if
nothing is received within the interval.  Default is a value of 0
which disables the sending of keepalive packets.

.IP "-pf \fIparameter_file\fR"
Specify a parameter file.  This argument is optional and if not
specified the default parameter file of \fBslink2orb.pf\fP will be
used.  Parameters expected in the parameter file are described below.

.IP "-S \fIstatefile\fR"
If a \fIstatefile\fR is specified, slink2orb will save the SeedLink
sequence number(s) of the last valid packet(s) received when exiting.
On startup, slink2orb will attempt to read the specified \fIstatefile\fR
and configure the SeedLink server to start with the next packet, if
possible.  Intermediate state saves can be enabled and controlled
with the \fIstateint\fR value in the parameter file (see below).

.IP "-r"
Use either the database specified with the -dm option or the local
foreignkeys database to remap input net, sta, chan, and loc codes
to local sta and chan codes.  This can be helpful when processing
this data with programs that do not recognize the loc code in the
source name.

.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "\fISeedLink\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the location of the SeedLink server
in [host]:port format.  If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.IP "\fIORB\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the location of the ORB server
in [host]:port format.  If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.SH PARAMETER FILE

An example \fBslink2orb.pf\fP parameter file is included with the
program distribution.

.SH CONVERSION OF MINISEED v3 to GENC

The SeedLink v4 protocol can deliver data in either miniSEED version 2
or the version 3.  Antelope systems support miniSEED version 2 natively and
these records are forwarded directly to the ORB as "SEED" type packets.

Because Antelope does not directly support miniSEED version 3 as
a packet type, the program will convert these records to GENC packet
types.  As a consequence, only records containing time-series data
samples of 32-bit integer and float values are converted.  Records
containing the following data types are not converted and are dropped:

.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
64-bit floats (doubles)
.IP \[bu] 2
Text data
.IP \[bu] 2
Header-only records
.RE

Furthermore, any details in the miniSEED header that are not supported by
the GENC packet type are lost by the conversion.

.SH NOTES

\fBWildcard network and station codes\fP

Some SeedLink servers have enhanced selection capability and are able
to handle wildcards ('*' or '?' characters) in the network and station
codes.  Servers that do not support this will return an error during
negotiation.

\fBAll/Uni-station Vs. Multi-station:\fP

Uni-station mode is a legacy connection mode used for getting a single,
implicit station configured by the server.  Multi-station mode is the method
used for requesting one or more stations explicitly.

Most users do not need to know the difference between these modes with
the one exception that some SeedLink servers, e.g. ringserver, implement
uni-station mode as all-station mode: if no network and station selection
is made during negotiation these servers will stream all the data to the
client (equivalent to wild-carding all the data streams).

.SH HISTORY
The SeedLink protocol was originally developed as part of the SeisComP
(Seismological Communication Processor) package.  For more information
