.SH NAME
slink2orb \- SeedLink to Antelope ORB module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
slink2orb [-dc database] [-dm database] [-nd delay]
          [-nt timeout] [-k interval] [-pf parameter_file]
          [-S statefile] [-r] [-v] SeedLink ORB

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBslink2orb\fP connects to a \fISeedLink\fR server, requests data and
forwards it to an \fIORB\fR ring buffer as packet type 'SEED'.  All
SeedLink data packets are 512-byte Mini-SEED records.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-dm \fIdatabase\fR"
Use the specified database for mapping SEED names to CSS database
names.  If the channel names do not exist in the specified database
they will be inserted.  If this database is not specified the local
foreignkeys database will be used.

.IP "-dc \fIdatabase\fR"
Copy calib, calper and segtype from the calibration table in the
specified database.  Recommended if the data will be processed
directly from the ORB since this information is not available
in the data stream.

.IP "-nd \fIdelay\fR"
The network reconnect delay (in seconds) for the connection to
the SeedLink server.  If the connection breaks for any reason
this will govern how soon a reconnection should be attempted.
The default value is 30 seconds.

.IP "-nt \fItimeout\fR"
The network timeout (in seconds) for the connection to the SeedLink
server.  If no data are received in this time the connection is closed
and re-established (after the reconnect delay has expired).  The default
value is 600 seconds. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

.IP "-k \fIinterval\fR (requires SeedLink >= 3)"
Keepalive packet interval (in seconds) at which keepalive (heartbeat)
packets are sent to the server.  Keepalive packets are only sent if
nothing is received within the interval.  Default is a value of 0
which disables the sending of keepalive packets.

.IP "-pf \fIparameter_file\fR"
Specify a parameter file.  This argument is optional and if not
specified the default parameter file of \fBslink2orb.pf\fP will be
used.  Parameters expected in the parameter file are described below.

.IP "-S \fIstatefile\fR"
If a \fIstatefile\fR is specified, slink2orb will save the SeedLink
sequence number(s) of the last valid packet(s) received when exiting.
On startup, slink2orb will attempt to read the specified \fIstatefile\fR
and configure the SeedLink server to start with the next packet, if
possible.  Intermediate state saves can be enabled and controlled
with the \fIstateint\fR value in the parameter file (see below).

.IP "-r"
Use either the database specified with the -dm option or the local
foreignkeys database to remap input net, sta, chan, and loc codes
to local sta and chan codes.  This can be helpful when processing
this data with programs that do not recognize the loc code in the
source name.

.IP "-v"
Be more verbose.  This flag can be used multiple times ("-v -v" or 
"-vv") for more verbosity.

.IP "\fISeedLink\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the location of the SeedLink server 
in [host]:port format.  If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.IP "\fIORB\fR"
A required argument.  Specifies the location of the ORB server
in [host]:port format.  If 'host' is omitted 'localhost' is assumed.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
An example \fBslink2orb\fP parameter file:
.nf

#
#  slink2orb.pf, parameters for the SeedLink to ORB module
#

# Equivalent command line parameters override those specified here
# All parameters are optional

nettimeout    600     # network timeout (seconds), 0 to disable
netdelay      30      # network reconnect delay (seconds)
keepalive     0       # interval to send keepalive requests (seconds)
stateint      300     # interval to save the sequence number (packets)

selectors   BH?.D     # selectors recognized by SeedLink server, see below

stations &Arr{
#       NET_STA         [selectors]
        GE_EIL          BHZ.D  HHZ.D
        IU_KONO         BH?
        MN_AQU
# Some SeedLink servers can accept wildcards for network and station
        TA_*            BHZ
}

#(notes regarding "selectors" from a SeedLink configuration file)
#
#   The "selectors" parameter tells to request packets that match given
#   selectors. This helps to reduce network traffic. A packet is sent to
#   client if it matches any positive selector (without leading "!") and
#   doesn't match any negative selectors (with "!"). General format of
#   selectors is LLSSS.T, where LL is location, SSS is channel, and T is
#   type (one of DECOTL for data, event, calibration, blockette, timing,
#   and log records). "LL", ".T", and "LLSSS." can be omitted, meaning
#   "any". It is also possible to use "?" in place of L and S.
#
#   Some examples:
#   BH?            - BHZ, BHN, BHE (all record types)
#   00BH?.D        - BHZ, BHN, BHE with location code '00' (data records)
#   BH? !E         - BHZ, BHN, BHE (excluding detection records)
#   BH? E          - BHZ, BHN, BHE plus detection records of all channels
#   !LCQ !LEP      - exclude LCQ and LEP channels
#   !L !T          - exclude log and timing records

.LP
The parameters are further defined below.
.IP "\fInettimeout\fR"
Equivalent to the command line version.  Any value given on the command
line takes precedence.

.IP "\fInetdelay\fR"
Equivalent to the command line version.  Any value given on the command
line takes precedence.

.IP "\fIkeepalive\fR"
Equivalent to the command line version.  Any value given on the command
line takes precedence.

.IP "\fIstateint\fR"
If this value and a \fIstatefile\fR are specified, this is the interval (in 
seconds) at which the module will save the last valid SeedLink sequence
number.  This can be used to protect against abnormal (power failure)
program exits.  The default value is 0, which disables this feature.

.IP "\fIselectors\fR"
This can be used, as described above, to limit the data stream sent by
the SeedLink server to specific channels and types.  Multiple
selectors are separates by space(s).  The default is no defined
selectors which causes SeedLink to send all available types and
channels.  When using multi-station mode ('stations' array is
defined), this serves as default selectors.

.IP "\fIstations\fR array"
If this array is present then the connection is configured in
multi-station mode.  Stations must be specified in 'NET_STA' format with
following selector(s).  If no selectors are provided for a given station
then the selectors given with the 'selectors' parameter are used.  There
is NO expansion/wildcard capability, all stations desired must be
explicitly listed.

.SH "NOTES"
Currently, SeedLink only serves 512-byte Mini-SEED records (with an 8 byte
SeedLink header).  Received records are prepended with an Antelope packet
type 'SEED' header and are sent to the ORB, optionally including calib,
calper and segtype from a specified database.

\fBWildcard network and station codes\fP

Some SeedLink server have enhanced selection capability and are able
to handle wildcards ('*' or '?' characters) in the network and station
codes.  Servers that do not support this will return an error during
negotiation.

\fBAll/Uni-station Vs. Multi-station:\fP

All/Uni-station mode is an old connection method used for getting all
(or a single station depending on configuration of the server) data
streams from a server.  Multi-station mode is the method used for
requesting specific streams.  Most users do not need to know the
difference between these modes with the one exception that some
SeedLink servers implement uni-station mode as all-station mode, if no
network and station selection is made during negotiation these servers
will stream all the data to the client (equivalent to wildcarding all
the data streams).

The SeedLink protocol was originally developed as part of the SeisComP
(Seismological Communication Processor) package.  For more information
