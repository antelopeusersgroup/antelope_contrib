.SH NAME
orb_quake_email \- email reports of earthquakes from origin rows on orb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orb_quake_email [-pf pffile] orbserver
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
orb_quake_email watches an Antelope ORB-server for hypocenters, announced
as database rows of the CSS3.0 origin table. Upon detection of new 
hypocenters, orb_quake_email will mail a notification to the email addresses
in the parameter file. Orb_quake_email requires a database of places (in places1.0 format)
from which to calculate the distance of the detected earthquake. The pathname
to this database is also in the parameter file. Orb_quake_email will echo
a copy of each message to stdout.

The array specifying email recipients may contain a subsetting expression 
for the origin-table row, filtering out unwanted origins.

orb_quake_email dynamically rereads its parameter file for each hypocenter
being reported. 
.SH OPTIONS
-pf pffile specify an alternate name for the parameter file. The default is orb_quake_email.pf.
