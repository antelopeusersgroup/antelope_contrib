.TH IATRIGGER 1 
.SH NAME
iatrigger \- monitor an orbserver for earthquakes, making requests for Internet Accelerometer data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
iatrigger [-v] [-a time_string] [-p pfname] [-c cmdorbname] [-t target] orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBiatrigger\fP program watches an orbserver for earthquakes of interest, usually identified by 
an Antelope automatic real-time processing system. For earthquakes that match the trigger criteria specified 
in the \fBiatrigger\fP parameter file, requests are made to the \fBia2orb(1)\fP program to download
Internet Accelerometer data from all stations configured for on-demand waveform download (for further 
details, see the man-page for \fBia2orb(1)\fP). 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-c cmdorbname"
When \fBiatrigger\fP detects an earthquake of interest, it puts a command on an orbserver requesting that 
the \fBia2orb(1)\fP program download a range of waveform data for the earthquake. The \fIcmdorbname\fP 
option specifies the default orbserver name on which to put these command packets. This command-line 
option overrides the default value for \fIcmdorbname\fP given in the \fBiatrigger\fP parameter file. 
.IP "-a time_string"
By default, \fBiatrigger\fP starts processing packets at the most recent end of the orbserver to which 
it connects. This option allows the user to begin processing at the first packet after a time string
in any format accepted by str2epoch(3), as implemented in the orbposition(3) command. 
.IP "-p pfname"
Specify a parameter file for \fBiatrigger\fP other than the default \fIiatrigger.pf\fP. 
.IP "-t target"
When \fBiatrigger\fP detects an earthquake of interest, it puts a command on an orbserver requesting that 
the \fBia2orb(1)\fP program download a range of waveform data for the earthquake. The \fItarget\fP parameter 
specifies the default target name of the \fBia2orb(1)\fP instance which should service the waveform request.
This command-line option overrides the default value for \fItarget\fP given in the \fBiatrigger\fP parameter
file.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
.SS "Parameter File Parameters"
.IP cmdorbname
When \fBiatrigger\fP detects an earthquake of interest, it puts a command on an orbserver requesting that 
the \fBia2orb(1)\fP program download a range of waveform data for the earthquake. The \fIcmdorbname\fP 
parameter specifies the default orbserver name on which to put these command packets. This parameter may be 
overridden on the command-line.
.IP end_expr
When \fBiatrigger\fP finds an earthquake of interest, a request is made for a range of waveforms 
covering a time-span based on the origin time of the earthquake. The \fIend_expr\fP parameter 
gives a Datascope database expression (see the man-page dbexpressions(5)) that calculates the end of the 
requested time-window of waveforms based on the origin row of the earthquake in question. The actual data 
return may end slightly after this specified time, to align with the blocks of data available on the 
instruments. 
.IP select
The \fIselect\fP parameter gives a default orb select expression (see the man page orbselect(3)) for packets 
to retrieve from the orbserver named on the command line, in which to search for earthquakes of interest. 
This parameter may be overridden on the command-line.
.IP start_expr
When \fBiatrigger\fP finds an earthquake of interest, a request is made for a range of waveforms 
covering a time-span based on the origin time of the earthquake. The \fIstart_expr\fP parameter 
gives a Datascope database expression (see the man-page dbexpressions(5)) that calculates the start of the 
requested time-window of waveforms based on the origin row of the earthquake in question. The actual data
return may start slightly before this specified time, to align with the blocks of data available on the 
instruments. 
.IP target
When \fBiatrigger\fP detects an earthquake of interest, it puts a command on an orbserver requesting that 
the \fBia2orb(1)\fP program download a range of waveform data for the earthquake. The \fItarget\fP parameter 
specifies the default target name of the \fBia2orb(1)\fP instance which should service the waveform request.
This parameter may be overridden on the command line. 
.IP trigger_expression
This parameter gives a Datascope database expression (see the man-page dbexpressions(5)) to evaluate on 
each incoming origin row. If the expression evaluates to \fItrue\fP for the given earthquake, a waveform request
is made for that earthquake. If the \fItrigger_expression\fP evaluates to \fIfalse\fP, no request is made
for waveforms.
