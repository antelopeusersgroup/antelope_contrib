.SH NAME
ew2orb \- Import waveform data from Earthworm into an orb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBew2orb \fP[-p \fIpfname\fP] \fIorb\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBew2orb\fP module connects to one or more Earthworm export_generic
modules, importing waveform data from the requested sources. The module
is multithreaded, meaning that one instance can import data from several
different sources at once. The module is also dynamically reconfigurable,
which means that changes to the parameter file are monitored and
noticed automatically. There should be no need to stop and restart the program
after  removing an old connection or adding a new one.

The \fIorb\fP name to which to write data is specified on the command line. After
that, most of the \fBew2orb\fP configuration is in the \fBew2orb\fP parameter file,
named \fBew2orb\fP.pf by default. All data are written in MGENC packet format.

A sample parameter file is included below. The parameter
program_loglevel controls the overall level of logging output for the
program. The options for this setting are "quiet", "verbose", and
"veryverbose". The latter is meant for debugging purposes, and will
generate a great deal of output (several lines for each incoming
packet). The parameter calibration_database gives the name of a database
with calibration information for the incoming stations. Since Earthworm
waveform packets do not contain calibration data and the Antelope waveform
packets do contain calibration data, a database is necessary to
hold the calibration information. If this database is not found, ew2orb
will complain, and fill in the Antelope packets with null calibration
information. This database is also used for the 'segtype' field in the
Antelope packets. segtype is taken from the rsptype field of the
instrument table. calib and calper are taken from the corresponding fields
of the calibration table. Note that in order to make use of the instrument
table, the sensor table must also be present and have valid entries
for the incoming stations.

The bulk of the parameter file is contained in the 'import_from' array.
This array in turn contains one array for each data-import connection
desired. Each one of these input connections must have a name, which is
used to group the parameters for that connection in the import_from
array. This name may be chosen at user discretion (usually as a useful
mnemonic for the particular data connection). The name will be used in
a number of places throughout the program when labeling output messages.

Before describing in detail the contents of each import_from subarray,
we should note the 'defaults' array in the parameter file. This array
specifies the default parameters for Earthworm import connections.
If one of the parameters does not show up in the subarray describing
a particular connection, the value from the defaults array is used. Values in the
specific subarrays for each connection will override the defaults. A
description of the connection parameters follows:

.IP server_ipaddress
This gives the IP address of the Earthworm server from which to import data,
in dotted-decimal notation (a.b.c.d, e.g. 209.193.47.96). This
parameter is required, and must be specified for each individual connection.

.IP server_port
This is the TCP port-number on which an Earthworm export_generic
server is serving data.

.IP send_heartbeat_sec
The \fBew2orb\fP import module exchanges heartbeats with the remote export
module at regular intervals. This parameter specifies the interval, in seconds,
at which these heartbeats are sent by \fBew2orb\fP.

.IP send_heartbeat_string
The heartbeat sent out by \fBew2orb\fP must be a string which matches the
value being expected by the remote export module.

.IP expect_heartbeat_sec
This parameter describes, in seconds, how often to expect an incoming
heartbeat from the remote export module. Usually this value is set to
an amount of time notably longer than the actual export heartbeat interval,
to avoid unnecessary warning messages. If \fBew2orb\fP does not receive
a heartbeat within this interval, it will issue a warning message and
continue.

.IP export_heartbeat_string
This parameter is a regular expression (in the style of regex(5))
which the incoming heartbeat string must match.

.IP my_inst
This is the Earthworm institution code for \fBew2orb\fP to report itself
as when it sends out heartbeats. This institution code is translated
to an integer value by \fBew2orb\fP, according to the contents of the
earthworm.pf parameter file (For more details, see the man page earthworm(5)).

.IP my_mod
This is the Earthworm module id number for \fBew2orb\fP to report itself
as when it sends out heartbeats. This module code is translated
to an integer value by \fBew2orb\fP, according to the contents of the
earthworm.pf parameter file (For more details, see the man page earthworm(5)).

.IP loglevel
This is the level of logging information for the import thread in
question to put out. The allowed values are "quiet", "verbose", and
"veryverbose". If this option is not specified, it defaults to the
value of program_loglevel. As with the other parameters, this can
be changed dynamically, which can be useful to turn on veryverbose output
for a connection on which the operator has a question, then turn
off veryverbose output after resolution.

.IP select
Incoming stations (orb source-names, i.e. net_sta_chan, before they're
translated to any new names) which match this regular expression will
be allowed to go on the orb. The default, which is to leave this blank,
allows all incoming sources. Many values are possible here given the
flexibility of regular expressions. As an example, one could use an
expression such as the following to select several stations from a given
network:
.nf

         select UW_(ERW|MBW|MCW|STW)_.*
.fi

.IP reject
Incoming stations (orb source-names, i.e. net_sta_chan, before they're
translated to any new names) which match this regular expression will
be rejected and not allowed to go on the orb. The default, which is to
leave this blank, allows all incoming sources.

.IP default_segtype
Incoming stations without segtype values available in the calibration
database will be assigned this value for segtype in the Antelope orb
packets.

.IP srcname_morph
This table contains search-and-replace patterns used to rename channels
of seismic data. If left empty, the output source-names of stations
will correspond to the names taken out of the Earthworm packets. If desired,
individual stations may also renamed with entries like
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 3

        /CN_PFB_HHE/CN_TEST_BHE/

.fi
.in
.ft R
These patterns are actually fed to the morphtbl(3) routine, which means
that for the advanced user they may be regular expressions. For example,
the entry below would map all incoming data in the XX network to the
CN network:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf
.ne 3

        /XX_(.*)/CN_$1/

.fi
.in
.ft R
All matching patterns listed in the srcname_morph table will be applied.
For further details please see the documentation on the morphtbl(3) routine.

.IP timecorr
This array contains time shift values to be applied to certain of the
stations as they come in. The names should be specified as net_sta_chan
strings (using the designation with which the data comes in, i.e. before
any srcname_morph transformation has been applied). Each value should be
followed by the number of seconds to add to each data packet's timestamp.
Positive values will move the data further into the future.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pfname"
Specify an alternate parameter-file name for the \fBew2orb\fP module.
The default parameter file is "\fBew2orb\fP.pf".

.SH EXAMPLE
This example shows the standard usage of directing the ew2orb module
at a local orb. All of the rest of the information ew2orb needs, for
example the locations of the Earthworm servers to connect to, is contained
in the parameter file.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

\fBew2orb\fP and orb2ew replace the eworm2orb and orb2eworm programs, which
are deprecated.

There is no recovery mechanism in the Earthworm import/export_generic
protocol. Also, depending on the ring-buffer dynamics of the Earthworm
system on the sending side, it is possible for conditions
to occur where packets will be lost. There is no mechanism available on
which \fBew2orb\fP can rely in order to prevent this loss; if it happens, data
must be recovered by other means. One consequence of this is that
if import threads are stopped for reconfiguration, a small packet drop
will occur for that thread and data stream.

Received module numbers are translated according to the local contents
of earthworm.pf. If those do not match the translations at the remote
site, the names may be misleading in verbose output.

The translations of earthworm logo fields (institute, module, and type)
are set when first encountered and do not update even when the
underlying earthworm.pf parameter file changes. If changes are made
to these translations, the program must be restarted for them to be
recognized. Also, despite being specified in the earthworm.pf parameter
file, the INST_WILDCARD, MOD_WILDCARD, and TYPE_WILDCARD values are
hard-wired to zero as per Earthworm definition. The exception is if
one of the earthworm-logo numbers is not found and continually
shows up as, e.g., MOD_165. In this case the earthworm.pf parameter
file is checked upon each translation. Note that this can introduce
a small run-time inefficiency; it's advantageous to have translations
present in earthworm.pf for all modules, message types, and installations
encountered.

Because the select and reject subsetting is done on the receiving side,
bandwidth is used according to the number of packets being sent by the
remote export module, regardless of whether the ew2orb select and
reject expressions allow them to be put on the orb.

\fBew2orb\fP will dynamically adjust to changes in the calibration_database.
However, if the pathname of the database changes, \fBew2orb\fP must be
restarted. Note also that if changes are made to calibration values using
dbe(1), sometimes one must quit the dbe application for the changes to be
noticed by \fBew2orb\fP.

The timecorr array allows waveform timestamps to be shifted forward
and backwards in time. The amounts are left to user discretion; no
limits are placed on the amount of shifting. Shifting data too far
into the future may cause a host of downstream problems.

Currently only station and channel name are used in looking up calibration
information in the stations database (net and loc codes are ignored).
