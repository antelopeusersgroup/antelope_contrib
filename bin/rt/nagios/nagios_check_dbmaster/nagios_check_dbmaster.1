.TH NAGIOS_CHECK_DBMASTER 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
nagios_check_dbmaster \- a Nagios plugin to check dbmaster values, written in Python
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBnagios_check_dbmaster\fP [\fB\-v\fP|\fB\-V\fP] \fIorb\fP \fIdbmaster\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_dbmaster\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to the
.nf
Intermapper/Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The
plugin can be installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios
libexec directory) and called through the Nagios configuration
files.

If no orb or database named in the command line exists, or a Datascope
dbjoin or dbsubset results in an error, an "Unknown" state will be
returned.

If there are station packets missing from the orb that, according
to the dbmaster, should be there, a "Warning" state will be returned.

If there are records in the dbmaster that don't match station packets
in the orb a "Critical" state will be returned.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

To see more detailed output from the script, use the \fB\-v\fP or \fB\-V\fP
command line arguments. Note that this will return an invalid Nagios plugin
response, and should only be used when debugging.

Warning
List of warnings:
     - Missing orb sources error: F36A, CLWO, DRWO

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.nf
This assumes that Python, $ANTELOPE and other Antelope environment
variables have been set properly.

If an invalid \fIorb\fP is provided, the Python interface to Antelope
returns an invalid Nagios response due to how the orb routines
cannot currently be captured from printing to STDOUT.
