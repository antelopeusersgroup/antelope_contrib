.SH NAME
orbptrigger \- ORB packet trigger
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orbptrigger [-select packet] [-start {pktid|time}] [-number number]
	       [-state file] [-background] ORB command ...

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorbptrigger\fP listens to an ORB and exectutes a specified system
call (command string) when specified packets are read.  Simple
substitution can be performed for variables in the system call using 
parameters/fields from parameter file or database table packets.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-select \fIpacket\fR"
Select which packet name to listen for.  This can be any type of 
packet in the ORB.  The default is "/db/origin".

.IP "-start \fIpktid|time\fR"
Specify the starting position in the ORB.  If the argument is all
digits it is assumed to indicate a packet id, otherwise it is
processed as a time string.  The default starting position is the
next packet received by the ORB.

.IP "-number \fInumber\fR"
Only process this number of packets, exiting when fullfilled.  The
default is to listen forever.

.IP "-state \fIfile\fR"
Save/restore the position in the ORB to/from this \fIfile\fR

.IP "-background"
Run the specified system call in the background.  This simply adds
an '&' to the end of the command string before executing with system().
The default is to run the system call in the foreground.

.IP "\fIORB\fR"
Specifies the location of the ORB server in host:port format. This is
a required argument.

.IP "\fIcommand\fR"
The system call to be executed after reading a specified type of
packet.  After substitution (see below) this is executed with
a system( \fIcommand\fP ...) call.  This is a required argument.

.SH SUBSTITUTION

The command string is scanned for pairs of '%' or '@' characters.
Anything inside pairs of these delimiters is substituted with matching
values of parameters/fields from parameter file or database table packets.
This only works with these two types of packets. The delimiters must
fit the parameter/field name tightly, i.e. spaces inside the
delimiters are treated as part of the parameter/field name.  See
LIMITATIONS below.

.IP "Substitution with the '%' delimiter:"
Substitutions are made directly with parameters from parameter file packets
or fields in database packets

.IP "Substitution with the '@' delimiter:"
This can only be used with parameter file packets.  Substitutions should
always be specified with the format '@<table>.<field>@'.  A database row
for a given <table> will be extracted from the parameter file packet and
the substitution will be with the value of <field> in that table record.
A database schema of 'css3.0' is assumed.

.SH EXAMPLES

>orbptrigger ORB /archive/addbulletin %evid% -lat %lat% -lon %lon%

This will execute the program /archive/addbulletin with %evid%,
%lat%, and %lon% replaced with the values of their respective fields
in the database packet /db/origin (the default packet) that triggered
execution. The final command string might look like:
"/archive/addbulletin 71 -lat 14.6784 -lon 70.8901"

>orbptrigger -select /pf/orbpftrigger -number 2 ORB sendalert %start%

This will execute 'sendalert' with the substituted value of 'start'
taken from a /pf/orbpftrigger packet for the next two /pf/orbpftrigger
packets read.

>orbptrigger -select IU_KONO_BHZ ORB /bin/date >> /log/KONO.recvd.packets

Sure, that's possible as well if you really want to do so.

>orbptrigger -select "/pf/orbmag" ORB report_mag @origin.evid@

This will execute 'report_mag' with 'evid' taken from the database
row/record for an 'origin' table inside the parameter file packet.

.SH "LIMITATIONS"

- Parameters in parameter file packets must be of type string, int, or
double.  Array (&Arr) and table (&Tbl) values cannot be used for
substitution.  A special exception is when using '@' delimiters for
substitution; usually database rows/records are then of type &Literal.

- Required values for the command line arguments that are expecting an
associated number, time, pktid, etc. are not robustly checked.

- Problems abound if the specified command string contains flags
that are recognized by orbptrigger.
e.g. 'orbptrigger ORB calc -number %lat%', will *not* work.

.SH "NOTES"

Any pre-pended spaces in the value of a database field are removed,
just to make the command line a little cleaner.

This program is very similar to orbpftrigger, with major differences
being:

- The ability to trigger on any arbitrary packet.

- The ability to substitute values from a database table packets/rows.

- Only simple substitution of variables, no expression evaluation is
performed.
